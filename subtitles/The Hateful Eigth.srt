1
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,202
Hyah! Huh!

2
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,765
Get in there now!

3
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,723
Get in! Get in!

4
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,842
Get in there, Dude!

5
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,007
Get in now!

6
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,091
Hyah! Come on! Huh!

7
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,965
All right! Huh!

8
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,004
Huh!

9
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,090
Whoa. Whoa.

10
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,850
Whoa.

11
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,407
Got room for one more?

12
00:05:14,372 --> 00:05:16,739
Who the hell are you?!

13
00:05:16,892 --> 00:05:18,576
And what happened to them?

14
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,568
Name's Major Marquis Warren,
former U.S. Cavalry.

15
00:05:23,774 --> 00:05:25,661
Currently a servant
of the court.

16
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:28,456
Trying to bring a couple
no-goods into market.

17
00:05:28,611 --> 00:05:30,613
Got the paperwork on 'em
in my pocket.

18
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,858
You takin' 'em into Red Rock?

19
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,813
Figure that's where
you headed, right?

20
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,170
I am.

21
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,741
That damn blasted blizzard

22
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,818
has been on our ass
for the last three hours.

23
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,210
There ain't no way we gonna
make it all the way to Red Rock

24
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:46,696
- 'fore it catches us.
- So you hightailin' it halfway,

25
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:47,935
to Minnie's Haberdashery?

26
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:50,091
You know I am.

27
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:51,449
May I come aboard?

28
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:53,570
Well, smoke,

29
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:56,737
if it up to me, yes.

30
00:05:56,888 --> 00:05:58,856
But it ain't up to me.

31
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:00,572
Who's it up to?

32
00:06:00,688 --> 00:06:02,417
Fella in the wagon.

33
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,973
Fella in the wagon
ain't partial to company?

34
00:06:05,087 --> 00:06:07,294
Fella in the wagon,
he paid for a private trip,

35
00:06:07,407 --> 00:06:08,977
and I'm here to tell you,

36
00:06:09,087 --> 00:06:10,930
he paid a pretty penny
for privacy.

37
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:13,857
So if you want to go
to Minnie's with us,

38
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:16,173
you gonna have to talk to him.

39
00:06:16,286 --> 00:06:18,766
Well...

40
00:06:18,886 --> 00:06:21,173
that's What I'll do.

41
00:06:22,726 --> 00:06:25,775
Hold it, black fella.

42
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:29,253
'Fore you approach,
you take them two guns of yours

43
00:06:29,365 --> 00:06:32,608
and you lay 'em on that rock
over yonder.

44
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:37,208
Then you raise both your hands
way above your hat.

45
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:39,486
Then you approach.

46
00:06:39,604 --> 00:06:41,049
Molasses-like.

47
00:06:42,164 --> 00:06:44,246
Real trustin' fella, huh?

48
00:06:44,364 --> 00:06:46,207
Not so much.

49
00:06:58,683 --> 00:07:00,730
Put 'em down.

50
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,250
Come on ahead.

51
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:14,729
I said way above your hat,
goddamn it!

52
00:07:16,121 --> 00:07:18,772
Now come forward.

53
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:20,685
That's far enough.

54
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,569
Well, I'll be dogged.

55
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,484
You a black fella I know.

56
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,927
Colonel somethin'- or-other
Warren, right?

57
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,963
Major Marquis Warren.

58
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,843
I know you, too.

59
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,927
We, uh, shared a steak dinner

60
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:42,007
once upon a time in Chattanooga.

61
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:43,928
You John Ruth The Hangman.

62
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,528
That'd be me.

63
00:07:45,638 --> 00:07:46,844
How long's that been?

64
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,369
Since that steak?

65
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:51,607
Oh... eight months.

66
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:54,198
So why don't you explain to me

67
00:07:54,318 --> 00:07:56,399
what a African
bounty hunter's doin'

68
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,680
wanderin' around in the snow
in the middle of Wyoming?

69
00:07:59,797 --> 00:08:01,757
Trying to get a couple
of bounties in to Red Rock.

70
00:08:01,877 --> 00:08:03,038
So you still in business?

71
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:04,602
You know I am.

72
00:08:04,757 --> 00:08:06,520
Happened to your horse?

73
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:09,924
Circumstances caused us to have
to take the long way round.

74
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:11,959
- My horse couldn't make it.
- Mm.

75
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:14,477
You don't know nothin'
'bout this filly here.

76
00:08:14,636 --> 00:08:16,047
Nope.

77
00:08:16,156 --> 00:08:18,442
- Don't even know her name?
- Nope.

78
00:08:18,555 --> 00:08:22,241
Well, I guess that makes this
one fortuitous wagon.

79
00:08:22,395 --> 00:08:24,318
I sure as hell hope so.

80
00:08:24,435 --> 00:08:27,996
Major Marquis Warren,
this here's Daisy Domergue.

81
00:08:29,514 --> 00:08:32,404
Domergue,
to you this is Major Warren.

82
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:34,004
Howdy, nigger.

83
00:08:35,674 --> 00:08:37,517
She's a pepper, ain't she?

84
00:08:37,634 --> 00:08:39,514
Now, girl, don't you know
the darkies don't like

85
00:08:39,594 --> 00:08:40,754
being called niggers no more?

86
00:08:40,913 --> 00:08:42,119
They find it offensive.

87
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:43,758
I been called worse.

88
00:08:43,913 --> 00:08:45,278
Laughs Now, that I can believe.

89
00:08:45,393 --> 00:08:46,804
You never heard of her, huh?

90
00:08:46,913 --> 00:08:48,244
Should I?

91
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:49,923
Well, she ain't no
John Wilkes Booth,

92
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:51,921
but maybe you might heard tell

93
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,875
about the price on her head.

94
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,756
- HOW much?
- $10,000.

95
00:08:55,872 --> 00:08:57,442
Damn.

96
00:08:57,592 --> 00:08:59,913
What'd she do,
kill Lily Langtry?

97
00:09:00,032 --> 00:09:01,636
Not quite.

98
00:09:01,752 --> 00:09:04,641
That ten thousand's practically
in my pocket.

99
00:09:04,751 --> 00:09:08,119
It's why I ain't too anxious
to be handin' out rides,

100
00:09:08,271 --> 00:09:10,672
especially to professionals
open for business.

101
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,316
I can certainly appreciate that.

102
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:15,274
But I ain't got no designs
on her.

103
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,041
One of my fellas over there
is worth $4,000,

104
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,199
another one's worth $3,000,
and one of 'em's worth $1,000.

105
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,755
That's damn sure good enough
for me.

106
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,914
Well...
let me see their paperwork.

107
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:30,272
Like I said, molasses-like.

108
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:40,109
Back off.

109
00:10:09,105 --> 00:10:11,153
Look, I sure hate
to interrupt you all,

110
00:10:11,265 --> 00:10:14,906
but we got a cold damn blizzard
that's hot on our ass

111
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:16,834
that we're tryin' to beat
to shelter!

112
00:10:16,945 --> 00:10:19,346
I realize that!
Now, shut your mouth

113
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:22,070
and hold them damn horses
while I think!

114
00:10:24,744 --> 00:10:27,190
Okay, boy, we'll give it a try.

115
00:10:27,344 --> 00:10:30,553
But you leave them two pistols
over yonder with the driver.

116
00:10:33,543 --> 00:10:35,864
Hey, uh, you ain't
really gonna let that nigger

117
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:37,394
ride in here, is ya?

118
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,063
I mean, maybe up there
with O.B., but...

119
00:10:41,063 --> 00:10:43,349
How ya like the sound
of them bells, bitch?

120
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:44,827
They real pretty, ain't they?

121
00:10:46,342 --> 00:10:48,231
You open up
your trashy mouth again,

122
00:10:48,342 --> 00:10:50,106
I'll knock out them
front teeth for ya.

123
00:10:50,222 --> 00:10:52,224
You got it?

124
00:10:52,342 --> 00:10:54,105
Yeah.

125
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:56,349
Let me hear ya say, "I got it. "

126
00:10:58,261 --> 00:11:00,912
I got it.

127
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:04,263
Uh, I'm gonna need a hand tyin'
these fellas up on the roof.

128
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,951
Give O.B. $50
when we get to Red Rock.

129
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,061
He'll help ya.

130
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,705
Well, I agree with O.B.

131
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,470
This storm got me concerned.

132
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,742
We get goin' a lot quicker
you helped out, too.

133
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,783
Goddamn it to hell,
I'm already regrettin' this.

134
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:19,789
Now, I can't likely help you
tie fellas to the roof

135
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:21,389
with my wrist cuffed to hers.

136
00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:23,308
And my wrist is gonna stay
cuffed to hers,

137
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:25,421
and she ain't never gonna
leave my goddamn side

138
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:28,382
till I personally put her
in the Red Rock jail!

139
00:11:28,498 --> 00:11:30,148
Now, do you got that?!

140
00:11:30,258 --> 00:11:31,908
Yeah, I got it.

141
00:11:32,018 --> 00:11:33,463
Good.

142
00:11:36,058 --> 00:11:37,707
Get in, Dude!

143
00:11:37,817 --> 00:11:39,228
Hut! Get in!

144
00:11:39,337 --> 00:11:42,102
Go on! Hut!

145
00:11:42,217 --> 00:11:43,582
Come on!

146
00:11:43,697 --> 00:11:47,258
Dude, Coconut, giddyup.

147
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:48,747
Yah!

148
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,735
Hut!

149
00:12:22,293 --> 00:12:24,421
Giddyup!

150
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:28,100
Yah! Cimarron! Leche! Get in!

151
00:12:28,213 --> 00:12:30,181
So, what happened to your horse?

152
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:31,818
Get in!

153
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:33,696
He was kinda old.

154
00:12:33,812 --> 00:12:36,497
I done had him for a bit.

155
00:12:36,612 --> 00:12:38,660
When the weather took a turn
for the worse,

156
00:12:38,772 --> 00:12:41,776
well, he done what he could,
but he couldn't make it.

157
00:12:41,892 --> 00:12:44,212
- Get in!
- That's too bad.

158
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:46,538
Yeah, it is.

159
00:12:46,651 --> 00:12:49,700
Me and ol' Lash done rode
a lot of miles together.

160
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,734
Could say he was my best friend,

161
00:12:51,891 --> 00:12:55,975
if I considered stupid animals
friends, which I don't.

162
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,536
Nevertheless,
I'm gonna miss him.

163
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,218
Leche! Ha!

164
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,492
Who's this Daisy Domergue?

165
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,300
A no damn good murdering bitch,
that's who.

166
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:09,013
Come on, boys! Get up!

167
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:10,619
I see you ain't got
mixed emotions

168
00:13:10,729 --> 00:13:12,219
about bringing a woman
to a rope.

169
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:15,179
By "woman," you mean her?

170
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:17,808
No, I do not have
mixed emotions.

171
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:19,259
Get in! Ha!

172
00:13:19,368 --> 00:13:21,530
So you taking her
into Red Rock to hang.

173
00:13:21,648 --> 00:13:22,854
You bet.

174
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,254
You gonna wait round
to watch it?

175
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:25,813
Oh, you know I am.

176
00:13:25,928 --> 00:13:28,090
- Come on!
- I want to hear her neck snap

177
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:29,538
with my own two ears.

178
00:13:29,647 --> 00:13:31,376
Get up, boys!

179
00:13:31,487 --> 00:13:33,933
You never wait to watch 'em hang?
Get up!

180
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,015
My bounties never hang,

181
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,368
'cause I never
bring 'em in alive.

182
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:40,807
- Never?
- Never ever.

183
00:13:40,926 --> 00:13:42,337
- Ha! Get up! Yah!
- We talked about this

184
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,926
in Chattanooga. Bringing
desperate men in alive's

185
00:13:45,046 --> 00:13:46,491
a good way to get yourself dead.

186
00:13:46,646 --> 00:13:48,535
- Get in there!
- Can't catch me sleeping

187
00:13:48,646 --> 00:13:49,932
if I don't close my eyes.

188
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:51,456
I don't want to work that hard.

189
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,408
No one said the job is
supposed to be easy.

190
00:13:53,525 --> 00:13:55,573
No one said it's supposed to be
that hard, neither.

191
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:58,575
- Get up, boys! Ha!
- But that, little lady,

192
00:13:58,685 --> 00:14:00,574
is why they call him
"The Hangman. "

193
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:03,255
When the handbill says
"dead or alive,"

194
00:14:03,364 --> 00:14:05,173
the rest of us
shoot ya in the back

195
00:14:05,284 --> 00:14:06,854
from up on top
of a perch somewhere,

196
00:14:06,964 --> 00:14:08,804
- bring ya in dead over a saddle.
- Get in!

197
00:14:08,844 --> 00:14:12,530
But when John Ruth The Hangman
catches ya,

198
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,645
you don't die from no bullet
in the back.

199
00:14:14,763 --> 00:14:16,367
Mm-mm.

200
00:14:16,483 --> 00:14:19,248
When The Hangman catches you,
you hang.

201
00:14:19,363 --> 00:14:22,287
Ha!

202
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,530
You overrate him, nigger.

203
00:14:24,682 --> 00:14:28,289
I give ya he got guts,
but in the brains department,

204
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:32,202
he like a man who took
a high dive in a low well.

205
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,890
Now, Daisy...

206
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:41,722
I want us to work out a signal
system of communication.

207
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:47,131
When I elbow you real hard in
the face, that means "shut up. "

208
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,651
You got it?

209
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,569
I got it.

210
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,480
Get in there!

211
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,527
Come on now, boys, get in!

212
00:15:08,598 --> 00:15:12,319
<i>Hey, little apple blossom</i>

213
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:17,245
<i>What seems to be
the problem?</i>

214
00:15:17,398 --> 00:15:20,685
<i>All the ones
you tell your troubles to</i>

215
00:15:20,797 --> 00:15:24,847
<i>They don't really
care for you</i>

216
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:28,166
<i>Come and tell me
what you're thinking</i>

217
00:15:28,277 --> 00:15:32,725
<i>'Cause just when the boat
is sinking</i>

218
00:15:32,836 --> 00:15:36,158
<i>A little light is blinking</i>

219
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:40,281
<i>And I will come
and rescue you</i>

220
00:15:40,396 --> 00:15:44,036
<i>Lots of girls
walk around in tears</i>

221
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:47,796
<i>But that's not for you</i>

222
00:15:47,915 --> 00:15:50,646
<i>You've been looking
all around for years</i>

223
00:15:50,755 --> 00:15:54,839
<i>For someone to tell
your troubles to -Ha!</i>

224
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,845
<i>Come and sit with me
and talk a while</i>

225
00:15:58,954 --> 00:16:02,800
<i>Let me see
your pretty little smile</i>

226
00:16:02,914 --> 00:16:05,883
<i>Put your troubles
in a little pile</i>

227
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:09,634
<i>And I will sort them out
for you, all right.</i>

228
00:16:12,753 --> 00:16:14,800
Hyah!

229
00:16:14,912 --> 00:16:15,879
Get in!

230
00:16:20,752 --> 00:16:22,083
Get in there!

231
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,842
Mm.

232
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,680
Giddyup!

233
00:16:34,351 --> 00:16:38,150
I, uh... I know we only
met each other the once before,

234
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,752
and, uh, I don't mean to
unduly imply intimacy, -Get up!

235
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,591
- But, well...
- Yah!

236
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,712
You still got it?

237
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,035
Do I still got what?

238
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:50,600
Get in, now!

239
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,837
The Lincoln letter.

240
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:54,599
Mm. Course.

241
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:57,030
Get up, boys!

242
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,674
- Got it on ya?
- Mm-hmm.

243
00:16:58,789 --> 00:16:59,675
Come on!

244
00:16:59,788 --> 00:17:00,755
Where?

245
00:17:00,908 --> 00:17:02,592
Right here.

246
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,358
Come on, boys! Get up!

247
00:17:04,468 --> 00:17:06,675
Look, I know you got to be
real careful with it and all,

248
00:17:06,828 --> 00:17:09,513
and I can imagine you probably
don't like taking it

249
00:17:09,668 --> 00:17:11,476
in and out of the envelope
all that often,

250
00:17:11,627 --> 00:17:13,470
- but, uh...
- Get up!

251
00:17:13,627 --> 00:17:17,518
If you wouldn't mind, I'd sure
appreciate seeing that again.

252
00:17:17,627 --> 00:17:19,072
Get in, boys!

253
00:17:19,187 --> 00:17:22,349
Ha! Giddyup!

254
00:17:22,466 --> 00:17:23,706
You're right.

255
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:25,954
I don't like
taking it in and out

256
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:28,228
- of the envelope that much.
- I... Yeah.

257
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:29,711
- But...
- Get in!

258
00:17:29,826 --> 00:17:32,715
Seeing's how you saved
my life and all...

259
00:17:32,825 --> 00:17:34,907
I suppose I could let you
read it again.

260
00:17:35,065 --> 00:17:37,113
Get in! Ha!

261
00:17:37,225 --> 00:17:39,705
Get in there!

262
00:17:41,945 --> 00:17:43,912
Get up now!

263
00:17:49,784 --> 00:17:51,229
Get in!

264
00:17:51,344 --> 00:17:52,755
Giddyup!

265
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,831
Huh!

266
00:17:58,983 --> 00:18:01,111
Get in, now!

267
00:18:05,383 --> 00:18:07,066
Get in!

268
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:21,906
"Ole Mary Todd's calling, so I
guess it must be time for bed. "

269
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:25,830
Ole Mary Todd.

270
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:28,386
Ha!

271
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,787
Get in!

272
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,141
- Well, that...
- Get up, boys!

273
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,147
That gets me.

274
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,468
Yeah, it gets me, too.

275
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,428
Get in! Get in!

276
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:42,628
You know what this is, tramp?
Hmm?

277
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:44,980
It's a letter from Lincoln.

278
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:47,579
- Letter from Lincoln to him.
- Get in there!

279
00:18:47,699 --> 00:18:48,985
Yeah.

280
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:51,066
They shared a correspondence
during the war.

281
00:18:51,218 --> 00:18:52,583
They was pen pals.

282
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:55,588
And this is just one of the letters.
Get up!

283
00:18:58,258 --> 00:19:00,022
What the...

284
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:02,185
- Hyah!
- O.B.!

285
00:19:02,297 --> 00:19:03,583
Stop!

286
00:19:03,697 --> 00:19:04,664
Whoa!

287
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:05,858
Easy.

288
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:07,308
Whoa.

289
00:19:11,177 --> 00:19:13,543
All the stupid...

290
00:19:13,696 --> 00:19:16,142
Like to rip my goddamn arm off!

291
00:19:49,613 --> 00:19:53,254
I didn't drag her stinking ass
up this goddamn mountain

292
00:19:53,373 --> 00:19:55,694
just for you to break her neck
on the outskirts of town!

293
00:19:55,813 --> 00:19:58,383
You the one handed her
my goddamn letter!

294
00:19:58,492 --> 00:20:00,017
I didn't give it to her,

295
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,100
I give it to you!

296
00:20:04,332 --> 00:20:06,460
That nigger like to bust my jaw.

297
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:10,936
You ruin that letter of his,

298
00:20:11,051 --> 00:20:13,019
that nigger gonna
stomp your ass to death.

299
00:20:13,131 --> 00:20:16,374
And when he do, I'm gonna
sit back on that wagon wheel,

300
00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:17,652
watch and laugh!

301
00:20:18,771 --> 00:20:20,534
How is it?

302
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,493
Well, she ain't help it none.

303
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,453
But it's all right.

304
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,291
Is that the way
niggers treat their ladies?

305
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,889
You ain't no goddamn lady!

306
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:39,454
Hey, Mr. Ruth!

307
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:41,178
What?

308
00:20:41,288 --> 00:20:43,575
There's another fella on foot
up here on the road.

309
00:20:43,688 --> 00:20:45,929
Hey!

310
00:20:46,048 --> 00:20:47,891
What?!

311
00:20:48,008 --> 00:20:52,968
I said there's another fella
on foot, up here on the road.

312
00:21:10,086 --> 00:21:12,976
Hey! Hey!

313
00:21:13,086 --> 00:21:15,850
Considering there's
a blizzard going on,

314
00:21:15,965 --> 00:21:17,535
whole lot of fellas
walking around,

315
00:21:17,685 --> 00:21:19,175
wouldn't you say, Major?

316
00:21:19,285 --> 00:21:21,174
Well, seeing as how
I'm half of them fellas,

317
00:21:21,285 --> 00:21:23,492
uh, yeah,
seems to be a lot of us.

318
00:21:23,645 --> 00:21:27,490
This changes things, son.

319
00:21:27,604 --> 00:21:31,086
$8,000 a lot of money
for a nigger.

320
00:21:31,204 --> 00:21:33,366
With a partner,
18's a whole lot better.

321
00:21:33,484 --> 00:21:36,930
You really think I'm in cahoots
with that fella, or her?!

322
00:21:37,043 --> 00:21:38,374
Put them on.

323
00:21:38,483 --> 00:21:39,843
Oh, I-I ain't wearing
no handcuffs.

324
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,846
You put those on,
or you can stop

325
00:21:41,963 --> 00:21:44,284
worrying about
this whole thing right now!

326
00:21:45,443 --> 00:21:47,047
Hey!

327
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,331
Hey!

328
00:22:07,081 --> 00:22:09,561
Hand your weapons to the driver.

329
00:22:09,681 --> 00:22:11,569
Little jumpy, ain't you?

330
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,570
Never mind the jokes.
Just do it.

331
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,125
If you say so.

332
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,248
I do.

333
00:22:40,118 --> 00:22:42,007
Okay.

334
00:22:42,118 --> 00:22:43,482
I done done it.

335
00:22:43,637 --> 00:22:45,366
913-, you got 'em?

336
00:22:45,477 --> 00:22:46,478
<i>I got 'em.</i>

337
00:22:46,637 --> 00:22:48,366
Okay, fella.

338
00:22:48,517 --> 00:22:50,884
You keep holding that lantern
in that one hand,

339
00:22:50,997 --> 00:22:54,126
and you keep that other hand
where I can see it.

340
00:22:54,236 --> 00:22:56,967
Walk over there where I can
get a good look at ya.

341
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:12,955
Well, I'll be
a goddamn dog in a manger.

342
00:23:13,075 --> 00:23:15,840
Is that you, Chris Mannix?

343
00:23:15,955 --> 00:23:17,843
I'm sorry, friend,
do we know each other?

344
00:23:17,954 --> 00:23:18,955
Not quite.

345
00:23:19,074 --> 00:23:20,360
You know this fella?

346
00:23:20,474 --> 00:23:22,602
Only by reputation.

347
00:23:22,754 --> 00:23:26,759
Like I said, friend, you got me
at a bit of a disadvantage.

348
00:23:26,874 --> 00:23:28,284
Keeping you at a disadvantage

349
00:23:28,393 --> 00:23:30,555
is an advantage
I intend to keep.

350
00:23:30,673 --> 00:23:33,677
Uh, whoever you are, mister,
you sure sound tough

351
00:23:33,793 --> 00:23:36,876
when you talking to a desperate
man knee-deep in snow.

352
00:23:36,993 --> 00:23:39,472
I, I... I don't want no trouble.

353
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:40,673
I just want a ride.

354
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:43,033
I, I'm freezing to death!

355
00:23:43,192 --> 00:23:44,682
Who is this joker?

356
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:49,400
You heard of the rebel renegade
Erskine Mannix?

357
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:51,479
- Mannix's Marauders?
- That's them.

358
00:23:51,591 --> 00:23:54,640
Scourge of South Carolina,
Mannix's Marauders.

359
00:23:54,751 --> 00:23:57,072
It's Erskine's youngest boy,
Chris.

360
00:23:57,191 --> 00:23:59,432
Brings you in my path,
Chris Mannix?

361
00:23:59,551 --> 00:24:02,952
Well, Mr. Face,
I was riding to Red Rock,

362
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,437
my horse stepped in
a gopher hole in the snow,

363
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,871
fucked up his leg,
had to put 'er down.

364
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,435
You got business in Red Rock?

365
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,080
- Yes, I do.
- What?

366
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,793
I'm the new sheriff.

367
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,434
Horseshit.

368
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:16,438
- 'Fraid not.
- Where's your star?

369
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:18,153
Well, I ain't the sheriff yet.

370
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:20,078
Now, once I get there,
they swear me in.

371
00:24:20,189 --> 00:24:21,839
But, uh, that ain't
happened yet.

372
00:24:21,949 --> 00:24:23,473
And-and that's when
you get your star.

373
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:25,750
You got anything that can
back any of this up?

374
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:28,109
Yeah. When we get to Red Rock.

375
00:24:28,228 --> 00:24:31,198
And-and from the look of those
three frozen fuckers up there,

376
00:24:31,308 --> 00:24:33,834
I, I figure you a bounty hunter
open for business.

377
00:24:33,988 --> 00:24:35,947
And-and I figure you taking
them three dead bodies

378
00:24:35,987 --> 00:24:37,989
into Red Rock to get paid?

379
00:24:38,107 --> 00:24:39,268
Three dead.

380
00:24:39,387 --> 00:24:40,274
One alive.

381
00:24:41,427 --> 00:24:42,314
Who's that?

382
00:24:42,427 --> 00:24:44,111
Daisy Domergue.

383
00:24:44,227 --> 00:24:46,274
Who the fuck is Daisy Domergue?

384
00:24:46,386 --> 00:24:49,913
Not a goddamn thing to nobody,
except me and the hangman.

385
00:24:50,026 --> 00:24:51,312
The hangman?

386
00:24:53,866 --> 00:24:57,153
Well, I'll be double-dog damned.

387
00:24:57,265 --> 00:24:58,790
You're "The Hangman" Bob Ruth!

388
00:24:58,905 --> 00:25:00,031
It's John.

389
00:25:00,145 --> 00:25:02,386
And you!

390
00:25:02,505 --> 00:25:04,155
You're the nigger with the head!

391
00:25:04,305 --> 00:25:06,307
Major Marquis!

392
00:25:06,425 --> 00:25:08,552
My Lord, is that really
the real head

393
00:25:08,664 --> 00:25:10,905
of Major Marquis
looking at me now?

394
00:25:11,064 --> 00:25:13,510
Yeah, it's really me,
and it's really my head.

395
00:25:13,624 --> 00:25:15,308
So what's going on?

396
00:25:15,424 --> 00:25:17,153
Uh, y'all having
a bounty hunters' picnic?

397
00:25:17,264 --> 00:25:18,708
Never mind.

398
00:25:18,823 --> 00:25:20,552
Uh, you taking
them three dead bodies

399
00:25:20,663 --> 00:25:22,552
and-and hurrying to Red Rock
to get paid, ain't you?

400
00:25:22,663 --> 00:25:23,903
Yeah.

401
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,388
Well, the man in Red Rock's

402
00:25:25,503 --> 00:25:29,144
supposed to pay you is me,
the new sheriff.

403
00:25:29,263 --> 00:25:31,026
So if y'all want to get paid,

404
00:25:31,142 --> 00:25:33,144
y'all need to get me
to Red Rock.

405
00:25:33,262 --> 00:25:35,151
Well, excuse me
for finding it hard to believe

406
00:25:35,262 --> 00:25:38,823
a town electing you to do
anything except drop dead.

407
00:25:38,942 --> 00:25:40,546
So I'm supposed
to freeze to death

408
00:25:40,661 --> 00:25:42,868
'cause you find something
hard to believe?

409
00:25:46,621 --> 00:25:48,544
No, I suppose not.

410
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,348
Put them on and come inside.

411
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,182
No.

412
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:09,264
Then you'll freeze.

413
00:26:09,379 --> 00:26:11,029
Then you'll hang.

414
00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:13,187
How so?

415
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:17,383
Stagecoach driver, could you
come down here and join us?

416
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:18,983
I got to hold these horses.

417
00:26:19,098 --> 00:26:21,226
I can hear you just fine
from up here.

418
00:26:21,378 --> 00:26:23,221
Well, you just heard me
tell this fella

419
00:26:23,378 --> 00:26:26,586
I'm the new sheriff
of Red Rock, right?

420
00:26:26,697 --> 00:26:27,619
Yeah.

421
00:26:27,737 --> 00:26:30,217
Red Rock is my town now.

422
00:26:30,337 --> 00:26:32,738
And I'm gonna enter my town
in bounty hunter's chains?

423
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:34,222
No, sir!

424
00:26:34,337 --> 00:26:35,702
Sorry, bushwhackers,

425
00:26:35,817 --> 00:26:37,978
I ain't entering Red Rock
that way.

426
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,825
Now, when you finally get
to Red Rock,

427
00:26:39,976 --> 00:26:42,866
you gonna realize every
goddamn thing I said was right.

428
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,263
And I expect you, O.B.,

429
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,776
to tell the townsfolk
of Red Rock

430
00:26:47,895 --> 00:26:50,739
that John Ruth let their
new sheriff freeze to death.

431
00:26:50,855 --> 00:26:52,744
Ain't no bounty on my head,
bushwhacker.

432
00:26:52,855 --> 00:26:55,938
You let me die, that's murder.

433
00:27:04,054 --> 00:27:06,022
Hold out your hands.

434
00:27:07,734 --> 00:27:09,622
O.B.!

435
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:11,701
Give the major back his iron.

436
00:27:13,413 --> 00:27:15,177
One thing I know for sure,

437
00:27:15,293 --> 00:27:16,977
this nigger-hating son of a gun

438
00:27:17,133 --> 00:27:19,261
ain't partnered up with you.

439
00:27:19,373 --> 00:27:22,455
Now, I'll help you protect
your 8,000,

440
00:27:22,572 --> 00:27:24,620
you help me protect my ten.

441
00:27:24,732 --> 00:27:26,416
Deal?

442
00:27:27,972 --> 00:27:29,861
Well, ain't love grand?

443
00:27:29,972 --> 00:27:32,451
Y'all want to lie on the ground
and make snow angels together?

444
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:35,532
Hut!

445
00:27:35,691 --> 00:27:37,853
Come on!

446
00:27:37,971 --> 00:27:39,939
Hyah!

447
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,255
Well, I'll tell you what, Bob.

448
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,650
The name's John.

449
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,330
- When we get to Red Rock,
- Hyah!

450
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,980
I'll buy you
and Major Marquis there

451
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,455
- dinner and booze.
- Get in!

452
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,856
My way of saying thanks.

453
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,336
I don't drink
with rebel renegades,

454
00:27:55,449 --> 00:27:57,895
and I damn sure
don't break bread with them.

455
00:27:58,049 --> 00:28:00,097
- Well, Mr. Ruth...
- Get up, boys!

456
00:28:00,209 --> 00:28:01,540
You sound like you got

457
00:28:01,649 --> 00:28:03,299
a axe to grind
against the Cause.

458
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:06,332
- "The Cause" of a renegade army?
- Get in!

459
00:28:06,448 --> 00:28:08,496
Bunch of losers gone loco.

460
00:28:08,608 --> 00:28:10,337
- You bet I do.
- Get up there! Hyah!

461
00:28:10,448 --> 00:28:12,048
You wrapped yourselves up
in a rebel flag

462
00:28:12,088 --> 00:28:13,613
as an excuse to kill and steal.

463
00:28:13,768 --> 00:28:16,134
And this ought
to interest you, Warren.

464
00:28:16,247 --> 00:28:18,648
Imparticular,
emancipated blacks.

465
00:28:18,767 --> 00:28:20,337
Sounds like my kind of fella.

466
00:28:22,847 --> 00:28:24,451
Sound to me you been reading

467
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:28,366
a lot of newspapers printed
in Washington, D.C.

468
00:28:28,486 --> 00:28:31,456
- Get in! Huh!
- Anywho, I'm just trying

469
00:28:31,566 --> 00:28:33,648
to let y'all know
how grateful I am.

470
00:28:33,766 --> 00:28:35,336
I was a goner.

471
00:28:35,446 --> 00:28:36,811
And y'all saved me.

472
00:28:36,926 --> 00:28:39,246
You want to show me
how grateful you are?

473
00:28:39,365 --> 00:28:41,129
- Get in there!
- Shut up.

474
00:28:42,725 --> 00:28:43,851
Goddamn it, Daisy.

475
00:28:44,005 --> 00:28:46,929
It's coming.

476
00:28:47,045 --> 00:28:48,376
Get in there, Cimarron!

477
00:28:48,485 --> 00:28:49,645
Here.

478
00:28:49,804 --> 00:28:50,691
Last piece.

479
00:28:50,844 --> 00:28:53,575
Get in!

480
00:28:53,724 --> 00:28:56,011
Get in, now!

481
00:28:56,124 --> 00:28:58,206
Hyah!

482
00:28:58,324 --> 00:29:00,167
Does he know...

483
00:29:02,043 --> 00:29:04,967
Does he know
how famous you once was?

484
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,323
I don't think so.

485
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:08,008
Giddyup!

486
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:09,773
Black Eye.

487
00:29:11,403 --> 00:29:12,962
- Do you know who he is?
- Get in!

488
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:15,482
Do I know
about the $30,000 reward

489
00:29:15,602 --> 00:29:17,923
the Confederacy put on the head
of Major Marquis?

490
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:19,646
Come on now, boys!

491
00:29:19,762 --> 00:29:21,207
- Get in!
- Yeah.

492
00:29:21,322 --> 00:29:23,164
Ah, them hillbillies
went nigger head-hunting.

493
00:29:23,281 --> 00:29:24,885
- Get in!
- They just never did get 'em

494
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:26,167
the right nigger head, did they?

495
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:28,204
No, they didn't.

496
00:29:28,321 --> 00:29:29,732
But it wasn't
for lack of trying.

497
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:31,406
Get in, boys! Ha! Get on!

498
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:33,361
Them peckerwoods
left their homes and families,

499
00:29:33,401 --> 00:29:36,244
and come up this snowy mountain
looking for me and fortune.

500
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,169
Ha! Get up!

501
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,884
Ain't none of 'em found fortune.

502
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,924
The ones you ain't
never heard of no more,

503
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,803
they found me.

504
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:47,126
Now, it didn't stay $30,000
the length of the war.

505
00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:48,604
Once passions cooled,

506
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:50,119
it dropped down to eight,
then five.

507
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:51,405
Get up, boys! Ha!

508
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:53,647
But I bet even
when it was 5,000,

509
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,409
you had your share
of country boys coming to call.

510
00:29:56,518 --> 00:29:59,647
Mm, you know I did.

511
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:02,409
Why'd they have a reward on you?

512
00:30:02,518 --> 00:30:04,919
Confederates took exception
to my capacity for killing 'em.

513
00:30:05,078 --> 00:30:06,518
Get up, now!

514
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:08,639
And after I broke
out of Wellenbeck,

515
00:30:08,757 --> 00:30:11,522
well, the South took
my continued existence

516
00:30:11,637 --> 00:30:13,401
- as a personal affront.
- Get up!

517
00:30:13,517 --> 00:30:16,407
- And the Cause put a reward on my head.
- Hmm.

518
00:30:16,517 --> 00:30:17,564
Get in there!

519
00:30:17,717 --> 00:30:20,196
What's, uh, Wellenbeck?

520
00:30:20,316 --> 00:30:21,841
You ain't never heard

521
00:30:21,956 --> 00:30:23,321
of Wellenbeck prisoner
of war camp, West Virginia?

522
00:30:23,436 --> 00:30:25,279
No, reb,
I ain't never heard of it.

523
00:30:25,396 --> 00:30:27,239
- Hyah!
- Did you bust out?

524
00:30:27,356 --> 00:30:28,801
Oh,

525
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:32,158
Major Marquis did more
than bust out.

526
00:30:32,275 --> 00:30:34,004
Major Marquis had a bright idea.

527
00:30:34,115 --> 00:30:35,196
Get in, now!

528
00:30:35,355 --> 00:30:37,642
So bright, you got to wonder

529
00:30:37,755 --> 00:30:40,076
why nobody never thought
about it before.

530
00:30:41,594 --> 00:30:43,642
Tell John Ruth your bright idea.

531
00:30:45,474 --> 00:30:47,795
Well, the whole damn place

532
00:30:47,954 --> 00:30:49,319
was just made out of kindling.

533
00:30:49,434 --> 00:30:50,720
Get in!

534
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:52,323
So I burnt it down.

535
00:30:54,873 --> 00:30:56,955
Get in! Hyah!

536
00:30:58,833 --> 00:31:02,360
There was a rookie regiment
spending overnight in the camp.

537
00:31:02,472 --> 00:31:05,555
47 men burnt to a crisp.

538
00:31:05,672 --> 00:31:08,721
- Southern youth, farmers' sons,
- Get up!

539
00:31:08,832 --> 00:31:09,958
Cream of the crop.

540
00:31:10,072 --> 00:31:11,676
And I say, "Let 'em burn. "

541
00:31:11,792 --> 00:31:15,238
I'm supposed to apologize
for killing Johnny Reb?

542
00:31:15,391 --> 00:31:18,076
You joined the war
to keep niggers in chains.

543
00:31:18,231 --> 00:31:20,074
I joined the war to kill

544
00:31:20,231 --> 00:31:21,801
- white Southern crackers.
- Ha! Get up!

545
00:31:21,911 --> 00:31:23,959
And that means killing 'em
any way I can.

546
00:31:24,111 --> 00:31:26,238
- Get in!
- Shoot 'em, stab 'em,

547
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,193
drown 'em, burn 'em,

548
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,631
drop a big ol' rock
on their head.

549
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,354
Whatever it took to put
white Southern crackers

550
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,234
in the ground, - O.B.: Get up!

551
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,113
That's what I joined
the war to do.

552
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:37,469
And that's What I did.

553
00:31:37,589 --> 00:31:39,637
To answer your question,
John Ruth,

554
00:31:39,789 --> 00:31:43,680
when Major Marquis
burned 47 men alive,

555
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:46,599
for no more reason than to give
a nigger a run for the trees,

556
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:48,517
that's when the South
put a reward

557
00:31:48,628 --> 00:31:49,914
on the head of Major Marquis.

558
00:31:50,028 --> 00:31:51,792
- And I made them trees, Mannix.
- Get in!

559
00:31:51,908 --> 00:31:53,637
You best believe
I ain't looked back

560
00:31:53,748 --> 00:31:55,512
till I crossed
the Northern line.

561
00:31:55,628 --> 00:31:57,357
Oh, but you had
a surprise waiting for you

562
00:31:57,468 --> 00:31:59,549
on the Northern side,
didn't you?

563
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,431
See, once they started
pulling out

564
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:04,027
all them burnt bodies
at Wellenbeck,

565
00:32:04,187 --> 00:32:06,508
seems not all them boys
were rebs.

566
00:32:06,627 --> 00:32:09,550
Why, you burn up
some of your own boys,

567
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:11,031
didn't you, Major?

568
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:13,513
How many burnt prisoners
they end up finding?

569
00:32:13,626 --> 00:32:15,435
Wasn't the final
Yankee death count

570
00:32:15,546 --> 00:32:18,026
something like 37?

571
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:19,511
Giddyup!

572
00:32:19,626 --> 00:32:21,309
That's the thing about war,
Mannix.

573
00:32:21,425 --> 00:32:22,870
People die.

574
00:32:22,985 --> 00:32:24,316
Oh.

575
00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:27,508
So you gonna chalk it up
to "war is hell," huh?

576
00:32:27,665 --> 00:32:30,066
Well, admittedly, that is
a hard argument to argue with.

577
00:32:30,185 --> 00:32:32,073
But if memory serves,

578
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:35,552
your side didn't look
at it that way.

579
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:38,065
I think they thought
37 white men

580
00:32:38,184 --> 00:32:40,551
for one nigger

581
00:32:40,664 --> 00:32:42,825
wasn't so hot a trade.

582
00:32:42,943 --> 00:32:46,231
- I do believe they accused you.
- Giddyup!

583
00:32:46,343 --> 00:32:47,629
Of being a kill-crazy nigger

584
00:32:47,743 --> 00:32:49,825
who only joined the war
to kill white folks,

585
00:32:49,943 --> 00:32:51,593
and the whole
blue and gray of it all

586
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:52,750
really didn't matter
that much to you.

587
00:32:52,863 --> 00:32:54,307
Ha! Get up!

588
00:32:54,422 --> 00:32:56,424
And that's why they drummed
your black ass

589
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:58,943
out of the cavalry with
a yellow stripe down your back.

590
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:02,225
- Get in!
- Isn't it, Major?

591
00:33:02,342 --> 00:33:03,707
Horseshit!

592
00:33:03,822 --> 00:33:05,301
If he'd have did all that,
the cavalry

593
00:33:05,381 --> 00:33:06,792
- would've shot him.
- Get in!

594
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,421
Well, I didn't say
they could prove it.

595
00:33:08,501 --> 00:33:09,866
- Get up!
- But they sure did

596
00:33:09,981 --> 00:33:11,904
think it out loud,
didn't they, Major?

597
00:33:12,021 --> 00:33:13,864
Hyah! Get up, boys!

598
00:33:13,981 --> 00:33:16,631
But Warren's war record
was stellar,

599
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,107
and that's what saved his ass.

600
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,381
Hyah!

601
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,309
Now, you killed yourself
your share

602
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:26,708
of redskins in your day,
didn't you, Black Major?

603
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:28,821
Cavalry tends
to look kindly on that.

604
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:31,829
I'll tell you what the cavalry
didn't look kindly on.

605
00:33:31,939 --> 00:33:33,509
- Giddyup!
- Mannix's Marauders,

606
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:35,269
- that's what.
- Get in! Hyah!

607
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:37,461
And the fact that
Erskine Mannix's little boy

608
00:33:37,579 --> 00:33:39,467
would talk
about anybody else's behavior

609
00:33:39,578 --> 00:33:42,980
during war time
makes me want to horse-laugh.

610
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:44,338
Hyah!

611
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:47,587
Don't you say anything
about my daddy.

612
00:33:47,738 --> 00:33:51,105
- What he fought for was dignity
in defeat, -O.B.: Get up there!

613
00:33:51,217 --> 00:33:53,538
And against
the unconditional surrender.

614
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:57,104
We weren't foreign barbarians
pounding on the city walls.

615
00:33:57,217 --> 00:33:59,219
- Ha!
- We were your brothers.

616
00:33:59,377 --> 00:34:00,707
Get up, now!

617
00:34:00,816 --> 00:34:02,625
We deserved dignity in defeat.

618
00:34:02,736 --> 00:34:05,501
Just how many
nigger towns did y'all sack

619
00:34:05,616 --> 00:34:08,017
in your fight
for dignity in defeat?

620
00:34:08,176 --> 00:34:10,463
Oh, my fair share, Black Major.

621
00:34:10,576 --> 00:34:13,181
- 'Cause when niggers
are scared, -O.B.: Huh!

622
00:34:13,295 --> 00:34:15,184
That's when white folks
are safe.

623
00:34:16,935 --> 00:34:19,779
You gonna talk
that hateful nigger talk,

624
00:34:19,935 --> 00:34:23,143
you can ride up top with O.B.

625
00:34:23,254 --> 00:34:24,460
No.

626
00:34:24,574 --> 00:34:26,144
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

627
00:34:26,254 --> 00:34:28,734
You done got me
talking politics.

628
00:34:28,854 --> 00:34:30,982
I didn't want to.

629
00:34:31,094 --> 00:34:34,142
Like I said, y'all,
I'm just happy to be alive.

630
00:34:34,253 --> 00:34:36,301
Get in, now!

631
00:34:36,453 --> 00:34:38,296
Ha! Get up!

632
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:41,536
I think I'll scoot over here
right by this window,

633
00:34:41,653 --> 00:34:46,135
and let this beautiful carriage
rock me to sleep.

634
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:49,057
And dream about how lucky I am.

635
00:34:52,772 --> 00:34:54,740
Get up, now!

636
00:34:57,531 --> 00:35:00,216
Ha!

637
00:35:44,967 --> 00:35:46,696
Hyah! Get in!

638
00:35:46,847 --> 00:35:48,133
Get in there!

639
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:49,487
Get in, hyah!

640
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:50,813
Get in there!

641
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:52,735
Get in!

642
00:35:52,846 --> 00:35:54,610
Get in there, Leche!

643
00:35:54,726 --> 00:35:56,535
Get in there!

644
00:35:56,646 --> 00:35:59,729
Whoa, whoa, easy.

645
00:35:59,846 --> 00:36:02,849
Whoa. Whoa.

646
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:26,087
What the hell is going on?

647
00:36:26,203 --> 00:36:29,127
We weren't expecting
another stage tonight!

648
00:36:29,243 --> 00:36:33,293
Yeah, I can see you already
got another one up in here.

649
00:36:33,403 --> 00:36:36,053
Just got through
putting the horses away.

650
00:36:36,162 --> 00:36:37,891
Well, this ain't
the normal line,

651
00:36:38,002 --> 00:36:40,892
but we are stuck on
the wrong side of a blizzard,

652
00:36:41,002 --> 00:36:43,243
so it looks like
you're stuck with us.

653
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:45,370
Are Minnie
and Sweet Dave inside?

654
00:36:45,482 --> 00:36:46,971
They ain't here.

655
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:49,368
I'm running the place
while they're gone.

656
00:36:51,081 --> 00:36:53,049
Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?

657
00:36:53,201 --> 00:36:55,010
He says they ain't here.

658
00:36:55,161 --> 00:36:57,368
He's looking after the place
while they're gone.

659
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,847
Who are you?

660
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,166
I'm Bob.

661
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,643
Well, whoever you are,
help O.B. with the horses.

662
00:37:09,799 --> 00:37:11,801
Come on.

663
00:37:11,919 --> 00:37:14,923
Get 'em out of this cold
'fore that blizzard hits us.

664
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:17,519
Whoa. You all right?

665
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:18,839
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

666
00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:19,965
Esperate, esperate, esperate!

667
00:37:20,078 --> 00:37:22,479
I just put
those other horses away.

668
00:37:22,598 --> 00:37:25,647
You need it done fast,
you need to help.

669
00:37:25,758 --> 00:37:28,238
I got two of my best men on it.

670
00:37:29,518 --> 00:37:31,804
You heard him, freeloaders.

671
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:34,045
Get to work!

672
00:37:34,197 --> 00:37:36,677
All right, you two,
unhook the leaders.

673
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:38,083
Come on, let's go.

674
00:37:38,197 --> 00:37:39,801
Open up!

675
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:41,442
- You have to kick it open!
- Ya got to kick it open!

676
00:37:41,557 --> 00:37:42,443
What?

677
00:37:42,556 --> 00:37:44,046
Kick it open!

678
00:37:44,156 --> 00:37:45,965
Shut that door.

679
00:37:46,076 --> 00:37:47,237
There's a goddamn blizzard
out there!

680
00:37:47,356 --> 00:37:48,721
You have to stop,
close the door!

681
00:37:48,876 --> 00:37:50,116
You got to nail it shut.

682
00:37:50,236 --> 00:37:53,001
You have to,
you have to nail it shut!

683
00:37:53,115 --> 00:37:54,480
Hold it shut!

684
00:37:54,595 --> 00:37:56,324
There's a hammer
and nails by the door!

685
00:37:56,435 --> 00:37:57,846
You have to nail it shut!

686
00:37:57,955 --> 00:38:01,038
There's a hammer and nails
by the door.

687
00:38:01,155 --> 00:38:03,044
- Give me a hammer.
- Yeah.

688
00:38:11,954 --> 00:38:13,558
You need,
you need two pieces of wood!

689
00:38:13,674 --> 00:38:15,402
You need two pieces of wood!
One ain't good enough!

690
00:38:15,513 --> 00:38:16,753
Two pieces of wood!

691
00:38:16,873 --> 00:38:19,240
The fuckin' thing is busted!

692
00:38:19,353 --> 00:38:22,084
Not just one piece of wood!

693
00:38:22,193 --> 00:38:23,593
Give me another piece of wood.

694
00:38:23,633 --> 00:38:25,601
Yeah. All right.

695
00:38:30,072 --> 00:38:31,676
- I need a nail.
- Here.

696
00:38:44,671 --> 00:38:46,241
<i>Jesus.</i>

697
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,391
That door's a son of a gun.

698
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,319
Who's the idiot who broke that,

699
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,398
that Mexican fella?

700
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,875
Oh, good heavens.

701
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,321
A woman?

702
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,760
Out in this white hell?

703
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:03,078
You must be frozen solid,
poor thing.

704
00:39:04,749 --> 00:39:07,480
Looks like Minnie's
got her a full house.

705
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:11,916
When did you fellas arrive?

706
00:39:12,028 --> 00:39:13,075
Ah.

707
00:39:13,188 --> 00:39:15,111
About 40 minutes ago.

708
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:16,992
That cowboy fella in the corner,

709
00:39:17,108 --> 00:39:19,031
- that your driver?
- No, no, he's a passenger.

710
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,071
The driver lit out.

711
00:39:21,188 --> 00:39:22,996
Said he was going to spend
the blizzard

712
00:39:23,107 --> 00:39:24,188
shacked up with a friend.

713
00:39:24,307 --> 00:39:26,913
Lucky devil.

714
00:39:27,027 --> 00:39:29,155
Jesus Christ, that's awful!

715
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:31,793
Christ Almighty,

716
00:39:31,907 --> 00:39:34,910
what'd that Mexican fella do,
soak his old socks in a pot?

717
00:39:35,026 --> 00:39:37,632
Yes, uh... I-I think
we all felt the same way,

718
00:39:37,746 --> 00:39:40,829
but were a little too polite
to say something.

719
00:39:40,946 --> 00:39:43,233
- He don't have that problem.
- Shit.

720
00:39:43,346 --> 00:39:45,029
Where's the well water?

721
00:39:45,145 --> 00:39:46,670
Uh, over there.

722
00:39:52,545 --> 00:39:56,071
So, all three of you fellas
headed to Red Rock

723
00:39:56,184 --> 00:39:58,949
when the blizzard
stopped you, huh?

724
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:02,227
Yes. All three of us were
on that stagecoach out there.

725
00:40:13,583 --> 00:40:16,154
Coffee beans.

726
00:40:16,303 --> 00:40:18,828
Uh, over there.

727
00:40:26,902 --> 00:40:29,108
Get your hand out of there.

728
00:40:33,101 --> 00:40:35,832
New sheriff of Red Rock's
travelin' with us.

729
00:40:35,941 --> 00:40:38,831
Ah, sheriff of Red Rock,
that'll be the day.

730
00:40:38,941 --> 00:40:41,784
He's a goddamn sheriff,
I'm a monkey's uncle.

731
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,981
Good.

732
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,306
Then you can share bananas

733
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,990
with your nigger friend
in the stable.

734
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,341
So,

735
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,706
the new sheriff of Red Rock
is traveling with you?

736
00:40:50,819 --> 00:40:52,150
Oh, he's lying.

737
00:40:52,259 --> 00:40:54,182
He ain't sheriff of nothin'.

738
00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:56,222
He's a Southern renegade.

739
00:40:56,379 --> 00:40:58,029
He's just talking hisself

740
00:40:58,139 --> 00:40:59,903
out of freezing to death is all.

741
00:41:00,019 --> 00:41:01,986
What the fuck I tell you
about talking, huh?

742
00:41:02,098 --> 00:41:03,623
I'll bust you in the mouth

743
00:41:03,738 --> 00:41:05,979
right in front of these people.
I don't give a fuck!

744
00:41:06,138 --> 00:41:07,663
You never gave your name, sir.

745
00:41:07,778 --> 00:41:09,906
John Ruth.

746
00:41:10,058 --> 00:41:11,139
Are you a lawman?

747
00:41:11,258 --> 00:41:12,623
I'm taking her to the law.

748
00:41:12,738 --> 00:41:14,102
So you're a bounty hunter?

749
00:41:14,217 --> 00:41:16,458
That's right, buster.

750
00:41:18,537 --> 00:41:20,266
Do you have a warrant?

751
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:21,708
Yeah, course I do.

752
00:41:21,817 --> 00:41:23,103
May I see it?

753
00:41:26,456 --> 00:41:28,026
Why?

754
00:41:28,136 --> 00:41:31,219
Ah. You're supposed
to produce it upon request.

755
00:41:31,336 --> 00:41:34,067
How am I supposed to know
you're not a villain,

756
00:41:34,176 --> 00:41:36,576
kidnapping this woman,

757
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:38,663
without a warrant
in your possession?

758
00:41:40,735 --> 00:41:42,419
What's your name, buster?

759
00:41:42,535 --> 00:41:46,459
Well, it certainly isn't Buster.

760
00:41:47,734 --> 00:41:51,056
It's Oswaldo Mobray.

761
00:41:52,214 --> 00:41:53,579
Oswaldo?

762
00:41:53,694 --> 00:41:55,139
Yes.

763
00:41:56,334 --> 00:41:58,256
Well,

764
00:41:58,373 --> 00:42:01,661
I got my warrant, Oswaldo.

765
00:42:15,092 --> 00:42:16,218
I take it you're Daisy Domergue?

766
00:42:16,332 --> 00:42:17,936
- That's her.
- Yeah.

767
00:42:19,571 --> 00:42:21,175
I see.

768
00:42:22,811 --> 00:42:26,258
Uh, it says here
"dead or alive. "

769
00:42:26,371 --> 00:42:28,214
Yeah. It does.

770
00:42:28,331 --> 00:42:30,379
Well, transporting a desperate,

771
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:32,891
hostile prisoner such as her

772
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,859
sounds like hard work.

773
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,934
Wouldn't transporting her
be easier

774
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,495
if she were dead?

775
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:42,294
Well, no one said the job
was supposed to be easy.

776
00:42:42,409 --> 00:42:44,935
And why is her hanging proper
so important to you?

777
00:42:45,049 --> 00:42:46,858
Let's just say I don't like
cheatin' the hangman.

778
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:48,653
He got to make a living, too.

779
00:42:48,769 --> 00:42:51,136
Well, I appreciate that.

780
00:42:51,249 --> 00:42:54,138
Allow me to properly

781
00:42:54,248 --> 00:42:56,137
introduce myself.

782
00:42:56,248 --> 00:42:58,171
I'm Oswaldo Mobray,

783
00:42:58,288 --> 00:43:00,689
the hangman in these parts.

784
00:43:05,807 --> 00:43:07,696
- La-di-da.
- Ah.

785
00:43:07,807 --> 00:43:09,297
Looks like I brought you
a customer.

786
00:43:09,407 --> 00:43:10,533
Yeah, so it would appear.

787
00:43:10,647 --> 00:43:12,411
You ever spent two days or more

788
00:43:12,527 --> 00:43:15,609
locked up with one
of your customers before?

789
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:17,728
- I can't say I have.
- Don't talk to my prisoner.

790
00:43:17,846 --> 00:43:19,291
I talk to my prisoner,
that's it.

791
00:43:19,406 --> 00:43:20,487
- You got it?
- I got it.

792
00:43:20,606 --> 00:43:21,812
Jolly good.

793
00:43:21,926 --> 00:43:23,530
You got anything in here
besides coffee

794
00:43:23,646 --> 00:43:25,410
that can help warm us up?

795
00:43:25,526 --> 00:43:27,732
Well, the bar is open.

796
00:43:27,845 --> 00:43:30,496
Follow moi.

797
00:43:42,964 --> 00:43:45,968
Line, O.B.!

798
00:43:46,084 --> 00:43:47,734
Oh, whoa.

799
00:43:47,844 --> 00:43:49,368
Oh.

800
00:43:51,123 --> 00:43:52,807
Whoa.

801
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:14,291
Hey.

802
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,171
Whoa, Ace, whoa.

803
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,563
You're all right,
you're all right.

804
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,443
Come on, goddamn it. I'm cold!

805
00:44:39,879 --> 00:44:42,007
I'll feed and water the horses.

806
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:45,088
You go inside
and get some hot coffee.

807
00:44:45,198 --> 00:44:46,688
Got some stew cooking.

808
00:44:46,838 --> 00:44:47,885
Should be done soon.

809
00:44:47,998 --> 00:44:49,238
Now, look.

810
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:52,760
No matter how bad
this blizzard gets,

811
00:44:52,878 --> 00:44:55,005
we still got to feed
these horses

812
00:44:55,117 --> 00:44:57,723
and take a squat
from time to time.

813
00:44:57,837 --> 00:45:00,920
So me and Chris
better lay out a line

814
00:45:01,037 --> 00:45:03,199
from the stable
to the front door

815
00:45:03,357 --> 00:45:06,200
and from the front door
to the shithouse.

816
00:45:06,356 --> 00:45:07,846
Okay?

817
00:45:11,276 --> 00:45:12,880
Good idea.

818
00:45:13,996 --> 00:45:15,646
Come on, Chris.

819
00:45:17,355 --> 00:45:18,800
I'll give you a hand.

820
00:45:20,355 --> 00:45:23,040
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Go inside. Get warm.

821
00:45:23,155 --> 00:45:24,998
You're doin' stable work
in a goddamn blizzard.

822
00:45:25,115 --> 00:45:26,844
I offer to help, you say no?

823
00:45:28,394 --> 00:45:30,442
You're right, amigo.

824
00:45:30,554 --> 00:45:32,443
Muchas gracias.

825
00:45:34,674 --> 00:45:36,517
All right. Follow me.

826
00:45:47,433 --> 00:45:51,118
We're gonna drop one
every ten paces,

827
00:45:51,272 --> 00:45:52,842
- from here to the door.
- Yeah!

828
00:45:52,952 --> 00:45:54,761
All right!

829
00:46:54,427 --> 00:46:57,987
Now, you're wanted for murder.

830
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:00,154
For the sake of my analogy,

831
00:47:00,266 --> 00:47:02,314
let's just assume
that you did it.

832
00:47:02,426 --> 00:47:04,554
Now, John Ruth wants
to take you back to Red Rock

833
00:47:04,666 --> 00:47:06,589
to stand trial for murder.

834
00:47:06,706 --> 00:47:09,834
And if you're found guilty,

835
00:47:09,945 --> 00:47:11,549
the people of Red Rock

836
00:47:11,665 --> 00:47:13,588
will hang you
in the town square.

837
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,514
And, as the hangman,

838
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:18,834
I will perform the execution.

839
00:47:18,945 --> 00:47:21,550
And if all those things

840
00:47:21,664 --> 00:47:23,507
end up taking place,

841
00:47:23,624 --> 00:47:26,628
that's what civilized society

842
00:47:26,744 --> 00:47:30,066
calls justice.

843
00:47:30,183 --> 00:47:32,072
However,

844
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:35,346
if the relatives
and the loved ones

845
00:47:35,463 --> 00:47:37,227
of the person you murdered

846
00:47:37,343 --> 00:47:38,913
were outside that door
right now,

847
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:41,343
and after busting down
that door,

848
00:47:41,462 --> 00:47:43,908
they drug you out into the snow

849
00:47:44,022 --> 00:47:46,070
and hung you up by the neck,

850
00:47:46,182 --> 00:47:49,550
that would be frontier justice.

851
00:47:49,662 --> 00:47:52,585
Now, the good part

852
00:47:52,701 --> 00:47:54,430
about frontier justice

853
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:58,182
is it's very thirst-quenching.

854
00:47:58,301 --> 00:48:02,750
The bad part is
it's apt to be wrong as right.

855
00:48:02,861 --> 00:48:04,191
Well, not in your case.

856
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,660
In your case,
you'd have it coming.

857
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:08,903
But other people,
maybe not so much.

858
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:11,421
But ultimately,
what's the real difference

859
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,030
between the two?

860
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,780
The real difference is me.

861
00:48:16,899 --> 00:48:18,389
The hangman.

862
00:48:18,499 --> 00:48:20,263
To me, it doesn't matter
what you did.

863
00:48:20,379 --> 00:48:22,660
When I hang you, I'll get no
satisfaction from your death.

864
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:23,820
It's my job.

865
00:48:23,939 --> 00:48:25,384
I hang you in Red Rock.

866
00:48:25,539 --> 00:48:27,222
I move on to the next town.

867
00:48:27,338 --> 00:48:31,184
I hang someone else there.

868
00:48:31,298 --> 00:48:35,428
The man who pulls the lever
that breaks your neck

869
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:38,427
will be a dispassionate man.

870
00:48:38,537 --> 00:48:42,826
And that dispassion
is the very essence of justice.

871
00:48:42,937 --> 00:48:46,737
For justice delivered
without dispassion

872
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:51,498
is always in danger
of not being justice.

873
00:48:51,616 --> 00:48:53,027
Amen.

874
00:49:18,294 --> 00:49:19,705
No offense, cowboy fella.

875
00:49:19,814 --> 00:49:22,737
Just gettin' your attention.

876
00:49:22,853 --> 00:49:26,255
Yeah, well...

877
00:49:26,373 --> 00:49:28,296
You got it.

878
00:49:28,413 --> 00:49:31,064
What you writin', friend?

879
00:49:31,173 --> 00:49:33,459
Only thing I'm qualified
to write about.

880
00:49:33,572 --> 00:49:35,734
What's that?

881
00:49:35,892 --> 00:49:37,860
My life story.

882
00:49:37,972 --> 00:49:39,656
You're writing your life story?

883
00:49:39,812 --> 00:49:41,177
You bet I am.

884
00:49:41,292 --> 00:49:42,657
Am I in it?

885
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,335
You just entered.

886
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:49,501
Well, you like writing stories
so much,

887
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:51,818
why don't you tell me
the story that brings you here?

888
00:49:53,091 --> 00:49:54,660
Who's asking?

889
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,659
I am. John Ruth.

890
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:59,171
I'm bringing in this one
to Red Rock to hang.

891
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,492
And ain't no way I'm spending
a couple of nights

892
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,897
under a roof with somebody
I don't know who they are,

893
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:05,534
and I don't know who you are.

894
00:50:05,649 --> 00:50:07,617
So, who are you?

895
00:50:07,729 --> 00:50:09,618
Joe Gage.

896
00:50:09,729 --> 00:50:11,697
- What?
- That's my name.

897
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:13,015
Joe Gage.

898
00:50:13,129 --> 00:50:14,938
Okay, Joe Gage.

899
00:50:15,049 --> 00:50:16,777
Why you going to Red Rock?

900
00:50:16,928 --> 00:50:18,930
I ain't, I ain't,
I ain't going to Red Rock.

901
00:50:19,048 --> 00:50:20,493
Where you going?

902
00:50:20,608 --> 00:50:22,531
About nine miles
outside of Red Rock.

903
00:50:22,688 --> 00:50:23,735
What's there?

904
00:50:23,848 --> 00:50:25,179
My mother.

905
00:50:26,288 --> 00:50:27,574
Your mother?

906
00:50:27,687 --> 00:50:29,735
Listen, I'm just a cowpuncher.

907
00:50:29,847 --> 00:50:33,897
I just, uh, got back
from a long drive, and...

908
00:50:34,007 --> 00:50:38,535
and I wasn't just an ass
in a saddle this time.

909
00:50:38,647 --> 00:50:41,013
I was a partner.

910
00:50:41,126 --> 00:50:44,926
First time in my life
I made a pretty penny.

911
00:50:45,046 --> 00:50:46,616
And, uh,

912
00:50:46,726 --> 00:50:49,127
figured I'd come home

913
00:50:49,246 --> 00:50:50,929
and spend time with my mother

914
00:50:51,085 --> 00:50:52,769
for Christmas.

915
00:50:52,885 --> 00:50:54,410
Now, that's funny.

916
00:50:55,765 --> 00:50:57,529
'Cause you don't look like

917
00:50:57,645 --> 00:50:59,249
the coming-home-for-Christmas
type.

918
00:50:59,365 --> 00:51:02,925
Yeah, well,

919
00:51:03,044 --> 00:51:06,127
you know,
looks can be deceiving.

920
00:51:08,164 --> 00:51:11,134
Because I definitely am a

921
00:51:11,244 --> 00:51:15,134
coming-home-for-Christmas-
to-spend-time-with-Mother type.

922
00:51:16,443 --> 00:51:20,573
Christmas with Mother,
I mean, uh,

923
00:51:20,683 --> 00:51:22,685
it's a wonderful thing.

924
00:51:24,242 --> 00:51:26,609
Now, is that, uh,

925
00:51:26,722 --> 00:51:28,406
good enough for you,

926
00:51:28,522 --> 00:51:30,809
John Ruth?

927
00:51:32,082 --> 00:51:34,084
For now.

928
00:51:34,202 --> 00:51:36,727
You steer clear of my prisoner.

929
00:51:41,121 --> 00:51:43,249
Hello, old-timer.

930
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:46,804
General.

931
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,451
General.

932
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,282
You, sir, are a hyena.

933
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,440
I have no wish to speak to you.

934
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:05,167
I've been called worse.

935
00:52:07,279 --> 00:52:09,440
Fair enough, General.

936
00:52:10,718 --> 00:52:12,368
Sorry to bother you.

937
00:52:14,398 --> 00:52:15,968
Hey!

938
00:52:16,078 --> 00:52:17,918
- You gotta kick it open!
- Gotta kick it open!

939
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:19,641
- What?
- Kick it open!

940
00:52:19,757 --> 00:52:22,197
That latch, you gotta kick it open!
You gotta kick it open!

941
00:52:22,917 --> 00:52:24,123
Jesus Christ!

942
00:52:24,237 --> 00:52:25,602
- Close it!
- Close it!

943
00:52:25,757 --> 00:52:27,043
- Close the door!
- What?

944
00:52:27,157 --> 00:52:28,602
- Close it!
- The goddamn door!

945
00:52:28,757 --> 00:52:29,962
It doesn't have a latch.
Close it!

946
00:52:30,076 --> 00:52:31,556
It's already cold enough
in here!

947
00:52:35,516 --> 00:52:37,200
Doesn't have a latch.

948
00:52:37,316 --> 00:52:39,125
- You gotta hammer up a board.
- You gotta nail it shut!

949
00:52:39,236 --> 00:52:40,522
The hammer and nails
by the door.

950
00:52:40,636 --> 00:52:43,115
There's a hammer
and nails right there!

951
00:52:43,235 --> 00:52:45,397
Ah, God!

952
00:52:45,515 --> 00:52:47,836
- Hold this here, Chris.
- Here! Here.

953
00:52:55,634 --> 00:52:57,079
- Watch your fingers.
- Yeah.

954
00:52:57,194 --> 00:52:58,958
- Really nail it in!
- Yeah.

955
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:03,282
You need two pieces of wood.

956
00:53:03,393 --> 00:53:05,157
You got to hammer another one.

957
00:53:05,273 --> 00:53:07,037
One ain't good enough!

958
00:53:07,153 --> 00:53:09,076
It's gonna blow right open!

959
00:53:09,193 --> 00:53:10,274
Now, goddamn it!

960
00:53:10,393 --> 00:53:12,157
Gonna open if you don't ham...!

961
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:13,843
- Shut up!
- Ah, got it!

962
00:53:13,953 --> 00:53:16,239
Son of a bitch!

963
00:53:28,031 --> 00:53:29,396
Jesus Christ.

964
00:53:29,511 --> 00:53:31,400
That's door's a whore.

965
00:53:34,151 --> 00:53:35,482
Oh.

966
00:53:35,591 --> 00:53:37,240
I get it. "Haberdashery. "

967
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:39,193
That was a joke.

968
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:41,597
How's the coffee?

969
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:45,271
Now? Pretty good,
if I do say so myself.

970
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:49,354
Thank you.

971
00:53:51,749 --> 00:53:54,434
Ooh!

972
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:06,229
Ha! Navajo!

973
00:54:06,388 --> 00:54:08,117
Guess who he is.

974
00:54:10,027 --> 00:54:12,314
Buffalo Bill?

975
00:54:12,427 --> 00:54:14,031
Hardly.

976
00:54:14,187 --> 00:54:15,871
No. I'm...

977
00:54:15,987 --> 00:54:17,716
Oswaldo Mobray. I'm the...

978
00:54:17,827 --> 00:54:19,875
He's the hangman of Red Rock.

979
00:54:20,986 --> 00:54:22,147
Oh, you are?

980
00:54:22,266 --> 00:54:24,314
- Yes, I am.
- Well!

981
00:54:24,426 --> 00:54:26,997
- Uh, good to meet you, uh,
- Yeah.

982
00:54:27,106 --> 00:54:28,551
- Mr...?
- Uh, Mobray.

983
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:29,747
- Mobray.
- Yeah.

984
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:30,913
I'm Chris Mannix.

985
00:54:31,026 --> 00:54:32,436
The new sheriff in Red Rock.

986
00:54:32,545 --> 00:54:34,786
- Really?
- Pfft, horseshit!

987
00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:36,350
Pay no attention to him.

988
00:54:36,465 --> 00:54:37,955
Horseshit!

989
00:54:38,065 --> 00:54:39,785
Fella warmin' himself
by that potbelly stove

990
00:54:39,865 --> 00:54:42,345
is a hell of a driver named O.B.
Ah.

991
00:54:42,505 --> 00:54:44,905
That's the only thing
you've said that's the truth.

992
00:54:46,504 --> 00:54:48,586
You comin' into Red Rock
to hang Lance Lawson?

993
00:54:48,704 --> 00:54:50,824
Precisely. -Do you have
the execution orders on you?

994
00:54:50,864 --> 00:54:52,468
- In my bag.
- May I see 'em?

995
00:54:52,584 --> 00:54:54,187
Of course.

996
00:54:59,303 --> 00:55:01,510
Who's, uh, who's Lance Lawson?

997
00:55:01,623 --> 00:55:04,024
He's a fella been sittin'
in the Red Rock jail

998
00:55:04,143 --> 00:55:05,632
about a month now.

999
00:55:05,742 --> 00:55:07,824
He's the fella
who shot the fella

1000
00:55:07,942 --> 00:55:10,468
who was sheriff 'fore me.

1001
00:55:10,582 --> 00:55:12,869
Precisely.

1002
00:55:14,542 --> 00:55:16,669
Thank you.

1003
00:55:21,941 --> 00:55:24,547
What did she mean when she said,

1004
00:55:24,661 --> 00:55:27,504
"The bounty hunter's
nigger friend in the stable"?

1005
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:30,863
He's got a nigger bounty hunter
friend in the stable.

1006
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:33,108
But all that just to guard her?

1007
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:36,389
Uh, I don't think that was
the original idea, but...

1008
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,105
- that's the idea now.
- Oh. Mm.

1009
00:55:39,219 --> 00:55:41,506
Want a little snake bite
in your coffee?

1010
00:55:41,619 --> 00:55:43,383
Yeah.

1011
00:55:43,499 --> 00:55:45,024
Five of you?

1012
00:55:45,139 --> 00:55:47,141
Well, well, well, looks
like Minnie's Haberdashery

1013
00:55:47,259 --> 00:55:49,659
is about to get cozy
for the next few days.

1014
00:55:49,818 --> 00:55:51,308
Yes, it does.

1015
00:55:54,978 --> 00:55:56,389
- Here.
- Ah. Ah.

1016
00:56:00,418 --> 00:56:03,660
Are you the chap
with the Lincoln letter?

1017
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,586
The Lincoln what?

1018
00:56:05,697 --> 00:56:09,179
Yes. The letter
from Abraham Lincoln.

1019
00:56:09,337 --> 00:56:11,339
President Abraham Lincoln?

1020
00:56:11,457 --> 00:56:14,221
Yes. Weren't you pen pals?

1021
00:56:14,336 --> 00:56:16,543
With the president?

1022
00:56:16,656 --> 00:56:19,660
Well, I'm sorry, I heard
that somebody in your party

1023
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:21,540
had a letter
from Abraham Lincoln.

1024
00:56:21,656 --> 00:56:23,145
I assumed it was you.

1025
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:24,541
Not him!

1026
00:56:24,655 --> 00:56:27,340
Black fella in the stable.

1027
00:56:27,455 --> 00:56:28,945
The nigger...

1028
00:56:29,055 --> 00:56:32,343
in the stable has a letter
from Abraham Lincoln?

1029
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:34,104
Yeah.

1030
00:56:34,214 --> 00:56:38,936
The nigger in the stable has
a letter from Abraham Lincoln?

1031
00:56:53,973 --> 00:56:56,259
What'd you say
your name was again?

1032
00:56:56,372 --> 00:56:58,261
- Bob.
- Warren.

1033
00:56:58,372 --> 00:57:00,613
Minnie and Sweet Dave in there?

1034
00:57:00,732 --> 00:57:02,860
Minnie and Sweet Dave went
to visit her mother

1035
00:57:02,972 --> 00:57:04,736
on the north side
of the mountain.

1036
00:57:04,852 --> 00:57:06,297
- What?
- Yeah.

1037
00:57:06,412 --> 00:57:07,742
Minnie ain't here?

1038
00:57:07,851 --> 00:57:10,377
Yes, they're visiting
her mother.

1039
00:57:10,491 --> 00:57:12,573
- Her mother?
- Yes.

1040
00:57:12,691 --> 00:57:14,136
Hmm.

1041
00:57:15,731 --> 00:57:18,018
Never knew Minnie had a mother.

1042
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:23,100
Well, everybody's got a mother.

1043
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:26,533
Yeah, I suppose.

1044
00:57:29,409 --> 00:57:31,571
And she left you in charge?

1045
00:57:31,689 --> 00:57:33,054
Si.

1046
00:57:35,169 --> 00:57:38,252
That sure don't sound
like Minnie.

1047
00:57:38,369 --> 00:57:40,609
Are you calling me a liar?

1048
00:57:42,568 --> 00:57:45,048
Well, not yet I ain't.

1049
00:57:45,168 --> 00:57:47,409
Just sounds peculiar is all.

1050
00:57:47,528 --> 00:57:49,417
What sounds peculiar?

1051
00:57:49,528 --> 00:57:51,575
Well, first off,
Minnie never struck me

1052
00:57:51,687 --> 00:57:53,496
as the sentimental type.

1053
00:57:53,607 --> 00:57:57,407
And secondly, I can't imagine
Sweet Dave lifting his fat ass

1054
00:57:57,527 --> 00:57:59,287
out his chair long enough
to fetch well water

1055
00:57:59,367 --> 00:58:01,654
unless Minnie was laying
a frying pan upside his head,

1056
00:58:01,767 --> 00:58:03,768
let alone take a trip
to the north side.

1057
00:58:03,886 --> 00:58:06,127
Well, that sounds a whole lot

1058
00:58:06,246 --> 00:58:08,852
like you're calling me a liar,
mi negro amigo.

1059
00:58:10,726 --> 00:58:12,686
Yeah, it do sound a whole lot
like that, don't it?

1060
00:58:14,165 --> 00:58:16,850
But I still ain't done it yet.

1061
00:58:17,925 --> 00:58:20,929
Minnie still serve food?

1062
00:58:21,045 --> 00:58:23,776
- Do you consider stew food?
- Yes.

1063
00:58:23,885 --> 00:58:25,534
Then we serve food.

1064
00:58:25,644 --> 00:58:29,251
She still stinking up the place
with Old Quail pipe tobacco?

1065
00:58:33,244 --> 00:58:36,008
Minnie doesn't smoke a pipe.

1066
00:58:36,123 --> 00:58:38,205
She rolls her own.

1067
00:58:38,323 --> 00:58:40,894
Red Apple Tobacco.

1068
00:58:41,003 --> 00:58:45,008
But, mi negro amigo,
I think you already know this.

1069
00:58:45,123 --> 00:58:47,284
Yeah, I do, Senor Bob.

1070
00:58:47,402 --> 00:58:49,973
Just seeing if you do.

1071
00:59:06,761 --> 00:59:08,286
Come on!

1072
00:59:32,558 --> 00:59:33,844
Fill 'er up, O.B.

1073
00:59:33,958 --> 00:59:35,801
Yeah.

1074
00:59:35,918 --> 00:59:37,886
Goddamn it.

1075
00:59:39,678 --> 00:59:41,089
Thank you.

1076
00:59:48,957 --> 00:59:52,404
Well, cut my legs off
and call me Shorty.

1077
00:59:52,517 --> 00:59:55,804
Is that
General Sanford Smithers I see?

1078
00:59:57,476 --> 00:59:59,524
You got a good eye, son.

1079
00:59:59,636 --> 01:00:03,800
Ha-ha! Well, I'll be
double-dog damned!

1080
01:00:03,916 --> 01:00:05,917
General Sandy
"Don't Give a Damn" Smithers?

1081
01:00:09,155 --> 01:00:11,396
Captain Chris Mannix,
Mannix's Marauders.

1082
01:00:11,555 --> 01:00:13,045
Erskine's boy?

1083
01:00:13,155 --> 01:00:14,839
Yes, sir.

1084
01:00:14,955 --> 01:00:18,037
Uh... may I sit down, sir?

1085
01:00:18,154 --> 01:00:20,885
Well, according to the Yankees,
it's a free country.

1086
01:00:20,994 --> 01:00:24,237
General Sandy Smithers. Ha-ha!

1087
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:26,561
Boy...

1088
01:00:26,674 --> 01:00:28,198
oh, boy,

1089
01:00:28,313 --> 01:00:31,601
did my daddy talk about you!

1090
01:00:31,713 --> 01:00:35,399
I heard you gave
those Blue Bellies sweet hell.

1091
01:00:37,193 --> 01:00:39,274
Me and my boys did our part.

1092
01:00:39,392 --> 01:00:41,793
Just like Erskine and his boys
did their part.

1093
01:00:41,912 --> 01:00:43,676
Hell yeah, we did.

1094
01:00:43,832 --> 01:00:45,880
Yankee sons of bitches.

1095
01:00:45,992 --> 01:00:49,313
I never knew your father, son.

1096
01:00:49,431 --> 01:00:53,914
But I always respected
his resolve.

1097
01:00:54,031 --> 01:00:56,079
Well, thank you
for saying that, General.

1098
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:58,922
Your respect would have meant
the world to him.

1099
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:03,355
Can I get you some coffee?

1100
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:05,074
That'd be nice.

1101
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:07,278
Well, how about a blanket?

1102
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,713
That'd be even nicer.

1103
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:13,560
Hell, you know what?
You can have mine.

1104
01:01:16,949 --> 01:01:18,951
Here we go, General.

1105
01:01:20,549 --> 01:01:23,631
Ha-ha! So what brings you
out Wyoming way, sir?

1106
01:01:23,788 --> 01:01:25,597
If you don't mind my askin'.

1107
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:27,512
<i>My boy.</i>

1108
01:01:27,668 --> 01:01:31,229
Oh, you got a boy that lives
in Red Rock? -My son.

1109
01:01:32,308 --> 01:01:34,787
Chester Charles Smithers.

1110
01:01:34,907 --> 01:01:38,275
He died out here
a few years back.

1111
01:01:38,427 --> 01:01:40,509
Oh, forgive me, sir.

1112
01:01:40,627 --> 01:01:42,914
There's no forgiveness
needed, son.

1113
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:47,429
Like I said,
it was a few years back.

1114
01:01:47,546 --> 01:01:50,231
It was after
he'd served his service.

1115
01:01:52,266 --> 01:01:56,554
He came out here
to the hills of Wyoming...

1116
01:01:56,665 --> 01:01:58,474
to make his fortune.

1117
01:01:59,945 --> 01:02:03,313
Never to be heard from again.

1118
01:02:08,784 --> 01:02:12,834
I bought him a symbolic plot...

1119
01:02:12,944 --> 01:02:16,187
in the Red Rock cemetery.

1120
01:02:16,304 --> 01:02:20,672
And I'm here to advise
a stone maker on his headstone.

1121
01:02:20,783 --> 01:02:23,184
Was he a goner for sure?

1122
01:02:23,343 --> 01:02:25,391
No chance he could be livin'
the cold life

1123
01:02:25,503 --> 01:02:26,868
out in the woods?

1124
01:02:26,983 --> 01:02:29,792
It's a rough life,
but folks can learn it.

1125
01:02:29,902 --> 01:02:33,349
If he'd have done
what he came out here to do,

1126
01:02:33,462 --> 01:02:35,749
he'd have come home.

1127
01:02:37,502 --> 01:02:39,948
Hold it. Close it, close it!

1128
01:02:43,181 --> 01:02:45,991
You have to hold it closed
while I nail it shut.

1129
01:02:46,101 --> 01:02:48,308
Well, who's the idiot
broke the damn door?

1130
01:02:48,421 --> 01:02:49,911
Oh, j-j-j...

1131
01:02:50,021 --> 01:02:52,341
just fucking hold it closed!

1132
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:55,748
Orale, cabron!

1133
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,387
Hold it closed.

1134
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:02,065
Okay.

1135
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:03,783
One more.

1136
01:03:06,819 --> 01:03:09,584
Keep holding, keep holding,

1137
01:03:09,699 --> 01:03:11,588
my negro amigo.

1138
01:03:13,818 --> 01:03:16,708
We need two pieces of wood.

1139
01:03:19,458 --> 01:03:21,699
Orale, cabron! All right.

1140
01:03:21,818 --> 01:03:24,298
There you go, motherfucker!

1141
01:03:28,017 --> 01:03:30,224
Lot of hats, Senor Bob.

1142
01:03:30,337 --> 01:03:31,862
Huh?

1143
01:03:31,977 --> 01:03:33,945
Considering Minnie's
"no hats indoors" policy,

1144
01:03:34,057 --> 01:03:35,979
which, if I remember correctly,

1145
01:03:36,096 --> 01:03:38,019
was one of them
Bar of Iron rules.

1146
01:03:38,136 --> 01:03:40,742
Kind of rule she'd want kept up
in her absence.

1147
01:03:40,856 --> 01:03:42,745
You seem to have
a laissez-faire attitude

1148
01:03:42,856 --> 01:03:44,745
when it come to the hats.

1149
01:03:44,856 --> 01:03:46,221
I'm guilty.

1150
01:03:46,376 --> 01:03:49,026
I have a laissez-faire attitude
about the hats.

1151
01:03:49,135 --> 01:03:51,581
How about we forget
about the hats today

1152
01:03:51,695 --> 01:03:54,505
considering there is
a blizzard going on and on?

1153
01:03:54,615 --> 01:03:56,982
We'll make tomorrow
"No Hat Day"!

1154
01:04:04,454 --> 01:04:06,980
<i>- A large black dog.
- Now take my tip</i>

1155
01:04:07,094 --> 01:04:08,744
<i>Before you ship to join</i>

1161
01:04:21,172 --> 01:04:22,822
You know, my daddy...

1162
01:04:22,932 --> 01:04:24,582
I, I said that my-my daddy.

1163
01:04:24,692 --> 01:04:26,296
- Always said that Davis.
- A plum tree.

1164
01:04:26,452 --> 01:04:27,977
Was a courageous man,

1165
01:04:28,092 --> 01:04:29,776
but he should've put the capital

1166
01:04:29,892 --> 01:04:33,418
in Montgomery and not Richmond.

1167
01:04:33,531 --> 01:04:35,818
Yes, sir. I agree with that.

1168
01:04:35,931 --> 01:04:37,421
The army in northern Virginia
would've been used

1169
01:04:37,531 --> 01:04:39,295
in a very different way.
I said the army

1170
01:04:39,411 --> 01:04:42,414
of north Virginia would've been
used in a very different way!

1171
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:45,500
<i>They'll flog
the poaching out of you</i>

1172
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:47,851
<i>Out there in Botany Bay.</i>

1173
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:49,859
Shut up!

1174
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,777
QB.

1175
01:05:00,049 --> 01:05:02,814
Do you know that nigger, sir?

1176
01:05:02,929 --> 01:05:05,738
I don't know that nigger.

1177
01:05:05,848 --> 01:05:10,251
But I know he's a nigger,
and that's all I need to know.

1178
01:05:19,167 --> 01:05:20,612
Well...

1179
01:05:20,727 --> 01:05:22,809
that nigger
just ain't any nigger.

1180
01:05:22,927 --> 01:05:24,372
That nigger, he...

1181
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:25,818
General Sanford Smithers?

1182
01:05:25,967 --> 01:05:28,333
Battle of Baton Rouge?

1183
01:05:31,646 --> 01:05:33,330
Inform the nigger.

1184
01:05:33,446 --> 01:05:36,450
In the cavalry officer's uniform

1185
01:05:36,566 --> 01:05:39,250
that I had
a division of Confederates

1186
01:05:39,365 --> 01:05:41,606
under my command...

1187
01:05:41,725 --> 01:05:43,648
in Baton Rouge.

1188
01:05:43,765 --> 01:05:46,496
Major Nigger, General Smithers
wishes me to inform you...

1189
01:05:46,605 --> 01:05:49,175
I heard him, hillbilly.

1190
01:05:49,284 --> 01:05:53,846
Inform this old cracker
that I was in Baton Rouge also.

1191
01:05:53,964 --> 01:05:55,409
On the other side.

1192
01:05:57,004 --> 01:05:58,893
Oh, that's interesting.

1193
01:05:59,004 --> 01:06:00,846
Uh, General Smithers,

1194
01:06:00,963 --> 01:06:03,967
he said that he was also in
Baton Rouge on the other si...

1195
01:06:04,123 --> 01:06:05,613
Captain Mannix,

1196
01:06:05,723 --> 01:06:07,566
tell the nigger

1197
01:06:07,683 --> 01:06:10,050
that I don't acknowledge niggers

1198
01:06:10,163 --> 01:06:11,687
in Northern uniforms.

1199
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:13,685
You captured
a whole colored command

1200
01:06:13,842 --> 01:06:15,492
that day...

1201
01:06:15,602 --> 01:06:18,890
but not one colored trooper
made it to a camp, did they?

1202
01:06:19,002 --> 01:06:21,369
We didn't have the time
or the food...

1203
01:06:21,482 --> 01:06:24,564
nor the inclination...

1204
01:06:24,681 --> 01:06:27,048
to care for Northern horses

1205
01:06:27,161 --> 01:06:29,368
and least of all...

1206
01:06:29,521 --> 01:06:31,489
Northern niggers!

1207
01:06:31,601 --> 01:06:33,204
So we shot 'em where they stood!

1208
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,727
Gentlemen.

1209
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,764
Gentlemen.

1210
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,486
I know Americans aren't apt

1211
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,443
to let a little thing
like unconditional surrender

1212
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:47,210
get in the way of a good war.

1213
01:06:47,319 --> 01:06:50,084
But I strongly suggest
we don't restage

1214
01:06:50,199 --> 01:06:52,520
the Battle of Baton Rouge

1215
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:55,210
during a blizzard
in Minnie's Haberdashery.

1216
01:06:56,878 --> 01:06:58,528
Now, uh...

1217
01:06:58,638 --> 01:07:00,766
my Nubian friend...

1218
01:07:00,878 --> 01:07:03,643
while I realize
passions are high,

1219
01:07:03,758 --> 01:07:05,726
that was a while ago.

1220
01:07:05,838 --> 01:07:09,159
And if you shoot
this unarmed old man,

1221
01:07:09,277 --> 01:07:12,247
I guarantee
I will hang you by the neck

1222
01:07:12,397 --> 01:07:16,083
until you are dead
once we arrive in Red Rock.

1223
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,243
I damn well guarantee that, too.

1224
01:07:22,356 --> 01:07:23,721
Yeah, Warren,

1225
01:07:23,836 --> 01:07:25,486
that's the problem with old men.

1226
01:07:25,596 --> 01:07:27,439
You can kick 'em down the stairs

1227
01:07:27,556 --> 01:07:30,957
and say it's a accident,
but you can't just shoot 'em.

1228
01:07:31,075 --> 01:07:33,806
Uh, gentlemen... since we may be

1229
01:07:33,955 --> 01:07:35,957
trapped here,

1230
01:07:36,075 --> 01:07:37,964
close together-like,

1231
01:07:38,075 --> 01:07:40,281
for a few days,

1232
01:07:40,394 --> 01:07:43,796
may I suggest
a possible solution?

1233
01:07:45,074 --> 01:07:47,998
We divide Minnie's in half.

1234
01:07:48,114 --> 01:07:50,162
The Northern side

1235
01:07:50,274 --> 01:07:52,799
and the Southern side.

1236
01:07:52,913 --> 01:07:55,678
With the dinner table...

1237
01:07:55,793 --> 01:07:58,080
operating as a...

1238
01:07:58,193 --> 01:08:00,082
neutral territory.

1239
01:08:00,233 --> 01:08:03,202
We could say
that the fireplace...

1240
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:05,679
side of the room acts as a...

1241
01:08:05,792 --> 01:08:09,592
a symbolic representative of...

1242
01:08:09,712 --> 01:08:11,237
Georgia.

1243
01:08:13,111 --> 01:08:15,398
While the bar...

1244
01:08:15,511 --> 01:08:17,161
represents...

1245
01:08:20,951 --> 01:08:23,113
Philadelphia!

1246
01:08:23,231 --> 01:08:26,234
Long as the bar's
Philadelphia...

1247
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:28,273
I agree.

1248
01:08:35,629 --> 01:08:38,519
We still got that deal
we talked about in the wagon?

1249
01:08:38,629 --> 01:08:41,678
Thank you. -I help you
protect your $8,000,

1250
01:08:41,789 --> 01:08:45,191
- you help me protect my ten?
- Yeah, I suppose.

1251
01:08:46,268 --> 01:08:48,077
One of them fellas

1252
01:08:48,188 --> 01:08:51,670
is not what he says he is.

1253
01:08:51,788 --> 01:08:53,313
What is he?

1254
01:08:53,428 --> 01:08:56,432
In cahoots with this one,
that's what he is.

1255
01:08:56,548 --> 01:08:59,153
One of them,
maybe even two of them,

1256
01:08:59,267 --> 01:09:02,396
is here to see
Domergue goes free.

1257
01:09:02,507 --> 01:09:07,069
To accomplish that goal,
they'll kill everybody in here.

1258
01:09:07,187 --> 01:09:09,029
They got 'em a couple of days,

1259
01:09:09,146 --> 01:09:11,433
so all they got to do
is sit tight

1260
01:09:11,586 --> 01:09:14,954
and wait for a window
of opportunity.

1261
01:09:15,066 --> 01:09:17,637
And that's when they strike.

1262
01:09:19,346 --> 01:09:21,951
Huh, bitch?

1263
01:09:22,065 --> 01:09:24,591
If you say so, John.

1264
01:09:26,425 --> 01:09:28,746
Are you sure you
ain't just being paranoid?

1265
01:09:28,865 --> 01:09:31,754
Our best bet is
this duplicitous fella

1266
01:09:31,864 --> 01:09:34,788
ain't as cool a customer
as Daisy here.

1267
01:09:34,944 --> 01:09:37,550
He won't have
the leather patience it takes

1268
01:09:37,664 --> 01:09:40,395
to just sit here and... wait.

1269
01:09:40,504 --> 01:09:42,710
Waiting for an opportunity

1270
01:09:42,863 --> 01:09:46,072
and knowing it's the right one
isn't so easy.

1271
01:09:46,183 --> 01:09:47,947
He can't handle it,

1272
01:09:48,063 --> 01:09:49,986
he'll stop waitin'.

1273
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:52,071
Try and create his opportunity,

1274
01:09:52,183 --> 01:09:55,391
and that's when Mr. Jumpy
reveals himself.

1275
01:09:55,542 --> 01:09:58,432
Now, what you got
to say about all this?

1276
01:09:58,542 --> 01:10:00,112
What do I got to say?

1277
01:10:00,222 --> 01:10:03,112
About John Ruth's ravings?

1278
01:10:03,262 --> 01:10:06,470
He's absolutely right.

1279
01:10:06,581 --> 01:10:10,791
Me and one
of them fellas is in cahoots.

1280
01:10:10,901 --> 01:10:14,110
We're just waiting
for everybody to go to sleep.

1281
01:10:14,221 --> 01:10:16,746
That's when
we're gonna kill y'all.

1282
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:21,825
Okay, everybody.

1283
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:26,944
Hear this.

1284
01:10:28,779 --> 01:10:30,827
This here is Daisy Domergue.

1285
01:10:32,299 --> 01:10:35,189
She's wanted dead or alive
for murder.

1286
01:10:35,299 --> 01:10:37,869
$10,000.

1287
01:10:37,978 --> 01:10:40,629
That money's mine, boys.

1288
01:10:40,738 --> 01:10:43,389
Don't want to share it,

1289
01:10:43,498 --> 01:10:45,785
and I ain't gonna lose it.

1290
01:10:46,858 --> 01:10:48,746
When that sun comes out,

1291
01:10:48,857 --> 01:10:52,748
I'm taking this woman
into Red Rock to hang.

1292
01:10:58,777 --> 01:11:00,301
Now...

1293
01:11:03,656 --> 01:11:06,387
is there anybody here

1294
01:11:06,496 --> 01:11:09,545
committed to stoppin' me...

1295
01:11:09,696 --> 01:11:11,424
from doing that?

1296
01:11:21,894 --> 01:11:23,703
Really?

1297
01:11:23,814 --> 01:11:26,385
Nobody got a problem with this?

1298
01:11:32,014 --> 01:11:33,458
Well...

1299
01:11:33,573 --> 01:11:36,543
I guess that's
very fortunate for me.

1300
01:11:37,853 --> 01:11:39,343
However...

1301
01:11:39,453 --> 01:11:42,741
I hope you all understand

1302
01:11:42,893 --> 01:11:45,020
I can't just...

1303
01:11:45,132 --> 01:11:47,055
take your word.

1304
01:11:47,172 --> 01:11:49,823
Circumstances force me to...

1305
01:11:49,932 --> 01:11:51,980
take...

1306
01:11:52,092 --> 01:11:54,254
precautions.

1307
01:11:54,372 --> 01:11:57,181
When you say...

1308
01:11:57,291 --> 01:12:00,022
"precautions"...

1309
01:12:00,131 --> 01:12:03,692
why do I feel that you mean me?

1310
01:12:03,811 --> 01:12:05,620
Because I'm gonna take
your gun, son.

1311
01:12:05,731 --> 01:12:07,300
You are?

1312
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:08,855
Yes, I am.

1313
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:12,213
- Nothing personal.
- Just mine?

1314
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:14,981
Hangman's got himself
a gun, too.

1315
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:18,770
I'll be dealing with his gun
after I deal with yours.

1316
01:12:26,089 --> 01:12:28,012
I feel kind of...

1317
01:12:28,129 --> 01:12:30,017
naked without it.

1318
01:12:30,128 --> 01:12:32,938
Oh, I still got mine.

1319
01:12:34,848 --> 01:12:36,930
I'll protect you.

1320
01:12:45,367 --> 01:12:47,608
A bastard's work is never done.

1321
01:12:47,727 --> 01:12:49,809
Huh, John Ruth?

1322
01:12:49,927 --> 01:12:52,930
That's right, Joe Gage.

1323
01:12:53,046 --> 01:12:55,333
- Now, give me the gun.
- If you want it...

1324
01:12:56,926 --> 01:12:58,894
you're gonna have
to come and take...

1325
01:13:00,366 --> 01:13:02,254
Calm down.

1326
01:13:04,045 --> 01:13:07,015
Take your hand away
from your gun.

1327
01:13:10,405 --> 01:13:12,373
Blink if you're calm.

1328
01:13:13,484 --> 01:13:14,849
He blink?

1329
01:13:14,964 --> 01:13:16,295
He blinked.

1330
01:13:16,404 --> 01:13:19,613
Blink if you're
gonna remain calm.

1331
01:13:23,284 --> 01:13:24,967
He blinked.

1332
01:13:25,083 --> 01:13:26,892
Take his pistol.

1333
01:13:28,403 --> 01:13:30,485
I'm real sorry about this, son.

1334
01:13:32,403 --> 01:13:34,326
Like I said...

1335
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:36,763
nothing personal, just...

1336
01:13:36,882 --> 01:13:39,089
a precaution.

1337
01:14:24,118 --> 01:14:26,200
Pretty sneaky.

1338
01:15:00,955 --> 01:15:03,526
Afraid the same applies
to you, too,

1339
01:15:03,634 --> 01:15:06,080
Mr... Mobray.

1340
01:15:06,194 --> 01:15:08,162
Ah, precautions must be taken

1341
01:15:08,274 --> 01:15:11,562
because life
is too sweet to lose.

1342
01:15:15,873 --> 01:15:18,274
Hand me that little bucket.

1343
01:15:28,672 --> 01:15:31,403
QB.

1344
01:15:31,512 --> 01:15:33,879
Go to the outhouse.

1345
01:15:33,992 --> 01:15:37,632
Take this bucket and...
dump it down the shithole.

1346
01:15:39,711 --> 01:15:42,112
Why do I got to go outside?

1347
01:15:42,231 --> 01:15:43,881
Well, your jacket's already on,

1348
01:15:43,991 --> 01:15:46,995
and I sorta kinda trust you.

1349
01:16:18,668 --> 01:16:21,511
- Grab the other cup.
- Yeah, I got it.

1350
01:16:25,667 --> 01:16:27,749
After you, Major.

1351
01:16:44,385 --> 01:16:46,035
Okay.

1352
01:16:47,945 --> 01:16:51,028
I'm gonna cut you loose
while we eat.

1353
01:16:51,145 --> 01:16:54,546
Don't get any ideas.
I ain't goin' soft on ya.

1354
01:16:54,664 --> 01:16:57,474
Lift your ass
even one inch off that seat,

1355
01:16:57,584 --> 01:17:01,225
and I'll put a bullet
right in your goddamn throat.

1356
01:17:01,344 --> 01:17:03,585
Come here.

1357
01:17:20,942 --> 01:17:22,546
Oh.

1358
01:17:25,622 --> 01:17:28,022
So, Domergue...

1359
01:17:28,141 --> 01:17:31,270
I suppose this blizzard
counts as a stroke of luck

1360
01:17:31,381 --> 01:17:33,383
far as you're concerned.

1361
01:17:33,541 --> 01:17:35,509
You don't hear me
complainin', do ya?

1362
01:17:35,621 --> 01:17:37,749
No, I sure don't.

1363
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:48,185
Well, how 'bout you, Oswaldo?

1364
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,508
How 'bout me what?

1365
01:17:51,619 --> 01:17:53,030
Look...

1366
01:17:53,139 --> 01:17:55,221
considering all the things
I done for money,

1367
01:17:55,339 --> 01:17:57,228
I ain't one to judge, but...

1368
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:59,580
don't you feel
just the least little bad

1369
01:17:59,699 --> 01:18:02,099
about hangin' a woman?

1370
01:18:02,218 --> 01:18:05,028
Well, until they invent
a trigger a woman can't pull,

1371
01:18:05,138 --> 01:18:08,347
if you're a hangman,
you're going to hang women.

1372
01:18:08,458 --> 01:18:09,948
Well, hell, Ozzie, I guess

1373
01:18:10,058 --> 01:18:12,220
I ain't never looked at it
like that before.

1374
01:18:12,337 --> 01:18:14,783
When it comes to some of them
mean bastards out there,

1375
01:18:14,897 --> 01:18:16,740
it's the only thing
does the job.

1376
01:18:16,857 --> 01:18:19,747
You really only need
to hang mean bastards.

1377
01:18:19,857 --> 01:18:22,827
But mean bastards,
you need to hang.

1378
01:18:31,416 --> 01:18:34,067
You goddamn son of a bitch!

1379
01:18:35,295 --> 01:18:37,377
I almost died out there!

1380
01:18:40,575 --> 01:18:44,296
I ain't ever...
going out in that shit

1381
01:18:44,415 --> 01:18:47,543
ever, ever again!

1382
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:11,335
You okay, O.B.?

1383
01:19:11,452 --> 01:19:12,863
I'm fine.

1384
01:19:12,972 --> 01:19:14,781
I'll be fine.

1385
01:19:14,892 --> 01:19:17,941
I just need to get warm.

1386
01:19:22,211 --> 01:19:24,452
You want some stew, O.B.?

1387
01:19:24,571 --> 01:19:26,096
Stew?

1388
01:19:26,211 --> 01:19:28,691
Later.

1389
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:33,212
Oh, yeah.

1390
01:19:33,330 --> 01:19:35,298
That's nice.

1391
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:00,812
So...

1392
01:20:00,968 --> 01:20:02,936
how you doing, Black Major?

1393
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:05,015
I ain't in the mood,
Chris Mannix.

1394
01:20:05,127 --> 01:20:07,368
Leave me be from your horseshit.

1395
01:20:08,927 --> 01:20:10,929
John Ruth says
you got a Lincoln letter.

1396
01:20:11,047 --> 01:20:13,971
I told you, jackass,
go hee-haw someplace else.

1397
01:20:14,087 --> 01:20:15,690
That's right, John.

1398
01:20:15,806 --> 01:20:17,729
You did say that, didn't you?

1399
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:19,848
Yeah. I did.

1400
01:20:21,046 --> 01:20:23,777
So...

1401
01:20:23,886 --> 01:20:26,491
you got a letter
from Abraham Lincoln?

1402
01:20:26,605 --> 01:20:28,130
Yes.

1403
01:20:28,285 --> 01:20:30,970
The... Abraham Lincoln?

1404
01:20:31,085 --> 01:20:32,325
Yes.

1405
01:20:32,445 --> 01:20:33,810
Abraham Lincoln?

1406
01:20:33,925 --> 01:20:35,734
The president
of the United States?

1407
01:20:35,845 --> 01:20:37,653
Yes.

1408
01:20:37,764 --> 01:20:38,651
Of America?

1409
01:20:38,764 --> 01:20:39,811
Yes.

1410
01:20:39,964 --> 01:20:42,171
Wrote you a letter...

1411
01:20:42,284 --> 01:20:43,570
Personally?

1412
01:20:43,684 --> 01:20:44,970
Yes.

1413
01:20:45,084 --> 01:20:47,212
Personally,
as in "Dear Major Warren"?

1414
01:20:47,324 --> 01:20:49,530
No, personally,
as in "Dear Marquis. "

1415
01:20:49,643 --> 01:20:50,804
"Dear Marquis"?

1416
01:20:50,923 --> 01:20:52,254
Abraham Lincoln,

1417
01:20:52,363 --> 01:20:54,047
the president of
the United States of America?

1418
01:20:54,163 --> 01:20:55,289
Yes.

1419
01:20:55,403 --> 01:20:57,292
May I see it?

1420
01:20:57,403 --> 01:20:59,052
No, you may not.

1421
01:21:00,122 --> 01:21:02,045
But the way John tells it,

1422
01:21:02,162 --> 01:21:03,891
you weren't
jUSt some random nigger soldier

1423
01:21:04,002 --> 01:21:06,050
picked from a pile of letters.

1424
01:21:06,162 --> 01:21:09,291
Way John tells it...

1425
01:21:09,402 --> 01:21:11,324
y'all had a correspondence.

1426
01:21:11,441 --> 01:21:12,681
Yes.

1427
01:21:12,801 --> 01:21:14,849
The way John tells it...

1428
01:21:14,961 --> 01:21:18,522
y'all was practically pen pals.

1429
01:21:18,641 --> 01:21:20,961
Yes.

1430
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:24,004
And a pen pal's...

1431
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:26,521
practically a friend.

1432
01:21:37,599 --> 01:21:39,806
John Ruth...

1433
01:21:39,919 --> 01:21:41,842
you really think a nigger,

1434
01:21:41,959 --> 01:21:45,201
drummed out of the cavalry with
a yellow stripe down his back,

1435
01:21:45,358 --> 01:21:46,883
was practically friends

1436
01:21:46,998 --> 01:21:49,444
with the president of
the United States of America?

1437
01:21:53,398 --> 01:21:56,048
John Ruth, I hate to be the one
to break it to you,

1438
01:21:56,197 --> 01:21:58,928
but ain't nobody in Minnie's
Haberdashery ever corresponded

1439
01:21:59,077 --> 01:22:01,125
with Abraham Lincoln.

1440
01:22:01,237 --> 01:22:02,887
Least of all,

1441
01:22:03,037 --> 01:22:04,960
that nigger there!

1442
01:22:14,396 --> 01:22:16,682
Was all that horseshit?

1443
01:22:18,235 --> 01:22:20,556
Course it was.

1444
01:22:30,474 --> 01:22:33,125
Good one, Warren!

1445
01:22:33,274 --> 01:22:35,038
Talk that sass, nigger!

1446
01:22:35,194 --> 01:22:37,561
<i>Talk that sass!</i>

1447
01:22:47,313 --> 01:22:50,873
Well, I guess it's true
what they say about you people.

1448
01:22:53,832 --> 01:22:57,120
Can't trust a fuckin' word
comes out of your mouth.

1449
01:22:57,232 --> 01:23:00,792
What's the matter, John Ruth?

1450
01:23:00,911 --> 01:23:02,595
I hurt your feelings?

1451
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:05,032
As a matter of fact...

1452
01:23:05,151 --> 01:23:06,960
you did.

1453
01:23:10,071 --> 01:23:11,835
I, I know...

1454
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:14,715
I'm the only black son of a
bitch you ever conversed with,

1455
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:16,798
so I'm gonna cut you some slack.

1456
01:23:16,910 --> 01:23:19,675
But you got no idea
what it's like

1457
01:23:19,790 --> 01:23:22,634
being a black man
facin' down America.

1458
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:25,116
Only time black folks is safe

1459
01:23:25,229 --> 01:23:27,516
is when white folks is disarmed.

1460
01:23:27,629 --> 01:23:31,634
And this letter
had the desired effect

1461
01:23:31,749 --> 01:23:34,672
of disarmin' white folks.

1462
01:23:36,228 --> 01:23:38,993
Call it what you want.

1463
01:23:39,108 --> 01:23:42,112
I call it a dirty fuckin' trick.

1464
01:23:51,387 --> 01:23:53,867
You want to know why I lie

1465
01:23:53,987 --> 01:23:56,432
about somethin' like that,
white man?

1466
01:24:00,666 --> 01:24:03,954
Got me on that stagecoach,
didn't it?

1467
01:24:10,985 --> 01:24:13,352
Well, I'll tell you
like the good Lord told John.

1468
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:15,866
A letter from Abraham Lincoln
wouldn't have had

1469
01:24:15,985 --> 01:24:17,908
that kind of effect on me.

1470
01:24:18,025 --> 01:24:19,947
I might let a whore piss on it.

1471
01:24:20,064 --> 01:24:23,432
- I spit on it.
- Good for you, sister!

1472
01:24:40,223 --> 01:24:41,747
Warren.

1473
01:24:41,862 --> 01:24:44,388
Goddamn it,
you leave that old man alone.

1474
01:24:44,502 --> 01:24:46,470
Stand down, you son of a bitch.

1475
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:49,188
I shared a battlefield
with this man.

1476
01:24:49,302 --> 01:24:52,544
Or would you deny me that, too?

1477
01:24:55,581 --> 01:24:58,744
I suppose you were there.

1478
01:24:58,861 --> 01:25:00,590
May I Join you?

1479
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:07,501
Yes, you may.

1480
01:25:57,736 --> 01:25:59,339
Damn it.

1481
01:26:04,695 --> 01:26:08,177
So, how's life since the war?

1482
01:26:13,214 --> 01:26:16,263
Got both my legs.

1483
01:26:16,374 --> 01:26:19,696
Both my arms.

1484
01:26:19,854 --> 01:26:21,981
I can't complain.

1485
01:26:22,093 --> 01:26:25,620
Got a woman?

1486
01:26:25,733 --> 01:26:28,213
Fever took her
start of this last winter.

1487
01:26:28,333 --> 01:26:29,744
Mm.

1488
01:26:29,853 --> 01:26:31,582
What was her name?

1489
01:26:31,692 --> 01:26:34,059
Betsy.

1490
01:26:34,172 --> 01:26:36,573
Georgia gal?

1491
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:38,615
Augusta.

1492
01:26:40,452 --> 01:26:42,693
Atlanta boy, Augusta girl.

1493
01:26:44,651 --> 01:26:47,621
I used to raise Kentucky horses.

1494
01:26:47,731 --> 01:26:50,302
And her pa was the owner
of the breedership

1495
01:26:50,411 --> 01:26:52,493
where I bought
most of my ponies.

1496
01:26:54,730 --> 01:26:57,415
Goddamn it.

1497
01:26:57,530 --> 01:26:59,419
I made a good deal on her.

1498
01:26:59,530 --> 01:27:01,817
Took the stake he gave me

1499
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:04,331
and bought
a bunch of peach orchards.

1500
01:27:04,450 --> 01:27:06,531
Set myself up pretty well.

1501
01:27:06,689 --> 01:27:08,532
Did a hell of a lot better

1502
01:27:08,689 --> 01:27:11,818
than either one of my no-good
brothers, that's for damn sure.

1503
01:27:11,929 --> 01:27:13,818
Hmm.

1504
01:27:13,929 --> 01:27:16,295
Yeah, your boy come up here
a few years back.

1505
01:27:17,648 --> 01:27:21,130
He spoke highly
of his mama, too.

1506
01:27:21,288 --> 01:27:23,859
You knew my boy?

1507
01:27:23,968 --> 01:27:26,653
Did I know him?

1508
01:27:26,768 --> 01:27:28,292
Yep.

1509
01:27:29,767 --> 01:27:31,656
Yeah, I knew him.

1510
01:27:31,767 --> 01:27:34,247
You did not know my boy.

1511
01:27:37,647 --> 01:27:39,330
Suit yourself.

1512
01:27:42,526 --> 01:27:44,528
Did you know my son?

1513
01:27:44,646 --> 01:27:48,048
I know the day he died.

1514
01:27:48,166 --> 01:27:50,930
- Do you?
- No.

1515
01:27:51,045 --> 01:27:53,093
Do you want to know
what day that was?

1516
01:27:53,205 --> 01:27:54,650
Yes.

1517
01:27:57,965 --> 01:27:59,808
The day...

1518
01:27:59,925 --> 01:28:01,926
he met me.

1519
01:28:17,843 --> 01:28:19,652
He come up here

1520
01:28:19,763 --> 01:28:21,970
to do a little
nigger head-huntin'.

1521
01:28:22,083 --> 01:28:24,688
By then, the reward was, oh...

1522
01:28:24,842 --> 01:28:27,448
$5,000 and braggin' rights.

1523
01:28:27,562 --> 01:28:29,451
But to battle-hard rebs,

1524
01:28:29,562 --> 01:28:32,133
$5,000 just to cut off
a nigger's head?

1525
01:28:33,881 --> 01:28:36,487
That's good money.

1526
01:28:36,601 --> 01:28:39,764
So them Johnnies climbed
this mountain,

1527
01:28:39,881 --> 01:28:42,361
lookin' for fortune.

1528
01:28:42,481 --> 01:28:46,610
There wasn't no fortune
to be found.

1529
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,802
All they found...

1530
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:50,729
was me.

1531
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:55,410
All them crackers come up here
sang a different tune

1532
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:58,841
when they found theyself
at the mercy of a nigger's gun.

1533
01:29:02,079 --> 01:29:03,604
Let's just forget it.

1534
01:29:03,719 --> 01:29:06,928
I'll go my way, you go your'n.

1535
01:29:07,038 --> 01:29:09,040
That's your boy Chester talkin'.

1536
01:29:09,158 --> 01:29:11,729
You're a goddamn lie!

1537
01:29:11,838 --> 01:29:13,840
"If you just let me go home

1538
01:29:13,958 --> 01:29:16,120
"to my family, I-| swear...

1539
01:29:16,238 --> 01:29:19,958
I'll never set foot
in Wyoming again. "

1540
01:29:21,877 --> 01:29:24,005
That's what they all said.

1541
01:29:27,357 --> 01:29:29,643
Beggin' for his life...

1542
01:29:29,756 --> 01:29:31,724
your boy told me

1543
01:29:31,836 --> 01:29:35,602
his whole life story.

1544
01:29:37,356 --> 01:29:38,687
And you...

1545
01:29:38,796 --> 01:29:41,241
was in that story, General.

1546
01:29:41,355 --> 01:29:45,360
And when I knew me I had

1547
01:29:45,475 --> 01:29:47,045
the son...

1548
01:29:47,155 --> 01:29:50,796
of the Bloody Nigger Killer
of Baton Rouge...

1549
01:29:50,915 --> 01:29:54,361
I knew me
I was gonna have some fun.

1550
01:29:54,474 --> 01:29:57,364
You shut your
lyin' nigger lips up!

1551
01:29:57,514 --> 01:29:59,403
General Smithers,
don't you listen to him.

1552
01:29:59,554 --> 01:30:01,556
He didn't know your boy.

1553
01:30:01,674 --> 01:30:04,483
He just heard tell
why you're here, is all.

1554
01:30:04,593 --> 01:30:07,836
It was cold
the day I killed your boy.

1555
01:30:07,953 --> 01:30:09,682
And I don't mean

1556
01:30:09,793 --> 01:30:12,194
snowy-mountain-Wyoming cold,
uh-uh.

1557
01:30:12,313 --> 01:30:14,838
It was colder than that.

1558
01:30:14,952 --> 01:30:18,035
And on that cold day,
with your boy

1559
01:30:18,152 --> 01:30:21,793
at the business end
of my gun barrel,

1560
01:30:21,952 --> 01:30:24,478
I made him strip...

1561
01:30:24,592 --> 01:30:27,595
right down to his bare ass.

1562
01:30:29,991 --> 01:30:33,279
Then I told him
to start walkin'.

1563
01:31:01,348 --> 01:31:04,033
I walked his naked ass
for two hours

1564
01:31:04,148 --> 01:31:06,628
'fore the cold collapsed him.

1565
01:31:07,708 --> 01:31:10,517
You never even knew my boy?

1566
01:31:10,627 --> 01:31:12,948
No, he didn't!

1567
01:31:13,067 --> 01:31:14,307
He's just a sneaky nigger

1568
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:16,111
trying to get you
to go for that gun.

1569
01:31:16,227 --> 01:31:20,550
Then...
he commenced to beggin' again.

1570
01:31:20,666 --> 01:31:24,307
But this time,
he wasn't beggin' to go home.

1571
01:31:24,466 --> 01:31:27,868
Ah, he knew
he'd never see his home again.

1572
01:31:27,986 --> 01:31:30,227
He wasn't beggin'
for his life, neither,

1573
01:31:30,386 --> 01:31:33,946
'cause he knew
that was long gone.

1574
01:31:34,065 --> 01:31:37,274
All he wanted...

1575
01:31:37,385 --> 01:31:39,547
was a blanket.

1576
01:31:39,665 --> 01:31:43,066
Now, don't judge your boy too
harshly, General.

1577
01:31:43,184 --> 01:31:46,506
You ain't never been cold
as your boy was that day.

1578
01:31:48,664 --> 01:31:50,985
You'd be surprised

1579
01:31:51,104 --> 01:31:54,266
what a man that cold

1580
01:31:54,383 --> 01:31:57,068
would do for a blanket.

1581
01:31:57,183 --> 01:32:00,153
You want to know
what your boy did?

1582
01:32:02,823 --> 01:32:05,905
I pulled my big black pecker

1583
01:32:06,022 --> 01:32:08,389
out of my pants...

1584
01:32:08,502 --> 01:32:10,982
and I made him crawl
through the snow

1585
01:32:11,102 --> 01:32:13,946
on all fours over to it.

1586
01:32:21,621 --> 01:32:24,227
Then I grabbed me a handful

1587
01:32:24,341 --> 01:32:25,706
of that black hair

1588
01:32:25,821 --> 01:32:29,302
at the back of his head...

1589
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:33,823
and I stuck my big black johnson

1590
01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:38,103
right down his goddamn throat.

1591
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:41,826
And it was full of blood,
so it was warm.

1592
01:32:41,939 --> 01:32:45,944
Oh, you bet your sweet ass
it was warm.

1593
01:32:46,059 --> 01:32:50,143
And Chester Charles Smithers

1594
01:32:50,258 --> 01:32:53,944
sucked on that warm black dingus

1595
01:32:54,058 --> 01:32:56,379
for long as he could!

1596
01:33:07,697 --> 01:33:09,938
You're startin'
to see pictures, ain't ya?

1597
01:33:10,057 --> 01:33:11,945
Your boy...

1598
01:33:12,056 --> 01:33:14,343
black dude's dingus
in his mouth...

1599
01:33:14,456 --> 01:33:17,858
him sh-sh-shakin', him cryin',

1600
01:33:17,976 --> 01:33:19,546
me laughin'...

1601
01:33:23,455 --> 01:33:27,858
and him not understandin'.

1602
01:33:29,335 --> 01:33:30,985
But you understand,
don't you, Sandy?

1603
01:33:31,095 --> 01:33:34,894
I never did give your boy
that blanket...

1604
01:33:35,014 --> 01:33:37,620
even after all he did,

1605
01:33:37,734 --> 01:33:42,342
and he did everything I asked.

1606
01:33:44,014 --> 01:33:46,095
No blanket.

1607
01:33:46,213 --> 01:33:49,660
That blanket was just a
heart-breakin' liar's promise.

1608
01:33:50,733 --> 01:33:52,383
Kind of like those uniforms

1609
01:33:52,493 --> 01:33:54,541
the Union issued
those colored troops

1610
01:33:54,653 --> 01:33:58,452
that you chose
not to acknowledge.

1611
01:34:03,932 --> 01:34:08,061
So what you gonna do,
old man? Hmm?

1612
01:34:08,171 --> 01:34:11,698
You gonna spend
the next two, three days

1613
01:34:11,811 --> 01:34:15,020
ignorin' the nigger
that killed your boy?

1614
01:34:16,131 --> 01:34:19,771
Ignorin' how I made him suffer?

1615
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:23,611
Ignoring how I made him...

1616
01:34:23,730 --> 01:34:26,813
lick... all over my johnson?

1617
01:34:29,529 --> 01:34:33,534
Oh, the dumbest thing
your boy ever did

1618
01:34:33,649 --> 01:34:36,573
was to let me know...

1619
01:34:36,689 --> 01:34:39,135
he was your boy.

1620
01:35:19,245 --> 01:35:21,213
About 15 minutes has past

1621
01:35:21,325 --> 01:35:24,215
since we last left
our characters.

1622
01:35:24,324 --> 01:35:28,249
Joe Gage volunteered to take
Smithers' dead body outside.

1623
01:35:28,364 --> 01:35:31,493
Straws were drawn
to see who'd help him.

1624
01:35:31,604 --> 01:35:34,005
O.B. lost.

1625
01:35:34,124 --> 01:35:36,694
Chris, John Ruth and Oswaldo
had a vigorous debate

1626
01:35:36,803 --> 01:35:38,771
about the legality
of the self-defense murder

1627
01:35:38,883 --> 01:35:40,487
that just transpired.

1628
01:35:40,603 --> 01:35:43,049
Major Marquis Warren,
who was supremely confident

1629
01:35:43,203 --> 01:35:45,490
about the legality
of what just transpired,

1630
01:35:45,603 --> 01:35:48,253
ignored them,
sat at the table by himself

1631
01:35:48,362 --> 01:35:50,490
and drank brandy.

1632
01:35:52,402 --> 01:35:54,928
Captain Chris Mannix donned
the dead general's coat

1633
01:35:55,042 --> 01:35:57,726
and joined Oswaldo in lighting
the candles and lanterns.

1634
01:35:57,881 --> 01:35:59,724
Hey, Ozzie!

1635
01:35:59,881 --> 01:36:01,929
Now, you got the right idea.

1636
01:36:02,041 --> 01:36:04,009
Let's light this place up.

1637
01:36:04,121 --> 01:36:06,249
John Ruth held the door closed,

1638
01:36:06,361 --> 01:36:08,727
waiting for Joe Gage
and O.B. to return.

1639
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:16,450
Bob enjoyed a Manzana Roja.

1640
01:36:22,919 --> 01:36:25,923
Domergue, however,
hasn't moved from her spot

1641
01:36:26,039 --> 01:36:28,770
at the community dinner table
since John Ruth uncuffed her.

1642
01:36:28,879 --> 01:36:31,165
John Ruth.

1643
01:36:31,278 --> 01:36:33,679
Yeah.

1644
01:36:33,798 --> 01:36:36,199
Can I play that guitar
over there?

1645
01:36:36,318 --> 01:36:38,719
Let's go back a bit.

1646
01:36:38,878 --> 01:36:42,279
Your boy, black dude's dingus
in his mouth.

1647
01:36:42,397 --> 01:36:44,559
15 minutes ago, Major Warren

1648
01:36:44,717 --> 01:36:47,118
shot General Smithers
in front of everybody.

1649
01:36:47,237 --> 01:36:49,763
But about 40 seconds
before that,

1650
01:36:49,877 --> 01:36:51,845
something equally
as important happened,

1651
01:36:51,957 --> 01:36:54,084
but not everybody saw it.

1652
01:36:54,196 --> 01:36:56,563
While Major Warren
was captivating the crowd

1653
01:36:56,676 --> 01:37:00,044
with tales of black dicks
in white mouths,

1654
01:37:00,156 --> 01:37:01,965
somebody...

1655
01:37:02,076 --> 01:37:03,680
poisoned the coffee.

1656
01:37:03,796 --> 01:37:07,686
He did everything I asked.

1657
01:37:07,795 --> 01:37:09,638
No blanket.

1658
01:37:09,755 --> 01:37:12,838
And the only one
to see him do it...

1659
01:37:16,994 --> 01:37:19,201
was Domergue.

1660
01:37:24,394 --> 01:37:27,397
That's why this chapter
is called.

1661
01:37:27,513 --> 01:37:29,481
"Domergue's Got a Secret. "

1662
01:37:32,953 --> 01:37:35,524
John Ruth.

1663
01:37:35,633 --> 01:37:37,362
Yeah.

1664
01:37:37,512 --> 01:37:40,322
Can I play that guitar
over there?

1665
01:37:46,552 --> 01:37:48,236
Yeah.

1666
01:37:53,751 --> 01:37:56,914
You come back with
anything else but a guitar,

1667
01:37:57,071 --> 01:37:59,392
my pistol plays a tune.

1668
01:37:59,511 --> 01:38:02,161
"Domergue's Death March. "

1669
01:38:02,270 --> 01:38:03,601
You got it?

1670
01:38:03,710 --> 01:38:05,474
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

1671
01:38:55,665 --> 01:38:59,067
<i>Listen for a moment, lads</i>

1672
01:38:59,185 --> 01:39:02,792
<i>And hear me tell my tale</i>

1673
01:39:02,905 --> 01:39:06,431
<i>O'er the sea
from England shore</i>

1674
01:39:06,544 --> 01:39:10,344
<i>I was condemned to sail</i>

1675
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:13,752
<i>Jury found me guilty, sir</i>

1676
01:39:13,864 --> 01:39:17,152
<i>And said the judge, said he</i>

1677
01:39:19,303 --> 01:39:21,112
<i>For life, Jim Jones</i>

1678
01:39:21,223 --> 01:39:26,548
<i>I sentence you
across the stormy sea</i>

1679
01:39:29,062 --> 01:39:31,793
<i>Have no chance
of mischief there</i>

1680
01:39:31,902 --> 01:39:35,270
<i>Remember what I say</i>

1681
01:39:35,382 --> 01:39:38,465
<i>They'll flog the poaching
out of you</i>

1682
01:39:38,622 --> 01:39:41,989
<i>Out there in Botany Bay</i>

1683
01:39:42,101 --> 01:39:45,025
<i>Waves were high upon the sea</i>

1684
01:39:45,141 --> 01:39:48,668
<i>The winds approaching gales</i>

1685
01:39:50,421 --> 01:39:53,469
<i>I'd rather drowned in misery</i>

1686
01:39:53,580 --> 01:39:57,380
<i>Than come to New South Wales</i>

1687
01:39:58,940 --> 01:40:01,704
<i>The waves were high
upon the sea</i>

1688
01:40:01,819 --> 01:40:04,629
<i>When the pirates came along</i>

1689
01:40:04,739 --> 01:40:08,266
<i>But the soldiers
on our convict ship</i>

1690
01:40:08,379 --> 01:40:11,940
<i>Were full 500 strong</i>

1691
01:40:12,059 --> 01:40:15,346
<i>They opened fire
and somehow drove</i>

1692
01:40:15,458 --> 01:40:20,225
<i>That pirate ship away</i>

1693
01:40:20,338 --> 01:40:23,262
<i>I'd rather join
that pirate ship</i>

1694
01:40:23,378 --> 01:40:27,018
<i>Than gone to Botany Bay</i>

1695
01:40:28,857 --> 01:40:30,666
<i>And one dark night</i>

1696
01:40:30,777 --> 01:40:35,100
<i>When everything is quiet
in the town</i>

1697
01:40:36,776 --> 01:40:39,507
<i>I'll kill you bastards
one and all</i>

1698
01:40:39,616 --> 01:40:42,586
<i>I'll gun the floggers down</i>

1699
01:40:42,696 --> 01:40:46,142
<i>Give them all a little shock</i>

1700
01:40:46,255 --> 01:40:50,579
<i>Remember what I say</i>

1701
01:40:50,695 --> 01:40:53,824
<i>Yet regret
they sent Jim Jones</i>

1702
01:40:53,935 --> 01:40:56,779
<i>In chains to Botany Bay.</i>

1703
01:41:02,734 --> 01:41:07,422
That's the one you like to sing
in the stagecoach, huh?

1704
01:41:07,534 --> 01:41:08,614
Yeah.

1705
01:41:08,733 --> 01:41:10,701
It's kinda pretty.

1706
01:41:10,813 --> 01:41:12,622
Got another verse to it?

1707
01:41:12,733 --> 01:41:14,656
Yeah, lots.

1708
01:41:16,453 --> 01:41:19,184
Well, go ahead, sing it.

1709
01:41:23,892 --> 01:41:26,054
Whatever you say, John.

1710
01:41:29,212 --> 01:41:32,294
<i>Now day and night
the irons clang</i>

1711
01:41:32,411 --> 01:41:36,132
<i>And like poor galley slaves</i>

1712
01:41:36,251 --> 01:41:39,300
<i>We toil and toil
and when we die</i>

1713
01:41:39,411 --> 01:41:43,017
<i>Must fill dishonored graves</i>

1714
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:45,895
<i>By and by
I'll break my chains</i>

1715
01:41:46,010 --> 01:41:50,937
<i>And to the bush I'll go</i>

1716
01:41:51,050 --> 01:41:56,010
<i>And you'll be dead
behind me, John</i>

1717
01:41:56,129 --> 01:41:59,815
<i>When I get to Mexico.</i>

1718
01:42:06,728 --> 01:42:09,208
Give me that guitar.

1719
01:42:11,728 --> 01:42:13,014
Music time's over!

1720
01:42:13,128 --> 01:42:14,334
Wha... Hey!

1721
01:42:14,448 --> 01:42:15,858
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

1722
01:42:15,967 --> 01:42:17,207
Whoa!

1723
01:42:17,327 --> 01:42:19,295
Turn around!

1724
01:42:26,646 --> 01:42:28,136
John, no!

1725
01:42:28,246 --> 01:42:29,771
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1726
01:42:29,886 --> 01:42:32,207
Shut up!

1727
01:44:15,557 --> 01:44:19,163
When you get to hell, John,

1728
01:44:19,276 --> 01:44:21,244
tell 'em Daisy sent ya.

1729
01:44:34,595 --> 01:44:38,042
Mannix, the coffee!

1730
01:45:31,470 --> 01:45:33,393
Oh, my God!

1731
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:36,035
Oh! Aah!

1732
01:45:37,309 --> 01:45:38,674
Give me that fucking gun.

1733
01:45:39,949 --> 01:45:42,111
Don't test me, bitch.

1734
01:45:45,389 --> 01:45:46,833
Everybody!

1735
01:45:46,948 --> 01:45:48,518
Get your backsides up

1736
01:45:48,668 --> 01:45:50,511
against that back wall
over yonder.

1737
01:45:50,668 --> 01:45:53,148
Well, goddamn it!

1738
01:45:53,268 --> 01:45:55,157
Get or don't get, Joe Gage.

1739
01:45:55,268 --> 01:45:56,679
It's up to you.

1740
01:45:56,788 --> 01:45:58,949
- I'm gettin'.
- Then get!

1741
01:46:11,306 --> 01:46:13,274
You, too, Senor Bob.

1742
01:46:18,306 --> 01:46:19,750
Everybody turn around

1743
01:46:19,905 --> 01:46:21,873
and put your hands on that wall.

1744
01:46:25,945 --> 01:46:28,027
Move them damn snowshoes!

1745
01:46:49,223 --> 01:46:51,066
Everybody keep your mouths shut.

1746
01:46:51,223 --> 01:46:52,792
Do like I say.

1747
01:46:52,902 --> 01:46:54,666
You open your mouth,

1748
01:46:54,782 --> 01:46:56,784
you gonna get a bullet.

1749
01:46:56,902 --> 01:46:58,142
Move a little sudden,

1750
01:46:58,262 --> 01:46:59,627
a little strange,

1751
01:46:59,742 --> 01:47:01,983
you gonna get a bullet.

1752
01:47:02,102 --> 01:47:04,342
Not a warnin', not a question.

1753
01:47:04,461 --> 01:47:06,190
A bullet.

1754
01:47:06,301 --> 01:47:08,622
You got that?

1755
01:47:08,781 --> 01:47:10,192
Let me hear you say, "I got it!"

1756
01:47:10,301 --> 01:47:11,587
- I got it.
- I got it.

1757
01:47:11,741 --> 01:47:12,822
I got it.

1758
01:47:12,941 --> 01:47:14,624
We have it.

1759
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:18,102
Chris Mannix,
come over here on this side.

1760
01:47:19,740 --> 01:47:21,105
Come on.

1761
01:47:26,379 --> 01:47:28,347
Take this gun out my holster.

1762
01:47:39,298 --> 01:47:41,141
Point it at them.

1763
01:47:42,538 --> 01:47:44,461
Now, like I said,

1764
01:47:44,578 --> 01:47:47,343
anybody does anything,

1765
01:47:47,458 --> 01:47:49,778
and I mean anything,

1766
01:47:49,897 --> 01:47:51,581
you kill 'em.

1767
01:47:55,377 --> 01:47:57,141
So...

1768
01:47:57,257 --> 01:47:59,145
you finally decided
I'm tellin' the truth

1769
01:47:59,256 --> 01:48:01,304
about bein' the sheriff
of Red Rock, huh?

1770
01:48:02,976 --> 01:48:05,138
I don't know about all that.

1771
01:48:05,256 --> 01:48:07,736
But I know you ain't the killer
poisoned that coffee,

1772
01:48:07,856 --> 01:48:10,381
'cause you almost drunk it
your own damn self.

1773
01:48:10,495 --> 01:48:12,065
One of them is.

1774
01:48:17,375 --> 01:48:18,456
Aah!

1775
01:48:18,575 --> 01:48:20,577
Ow!

1776
01:48:20,695 --> 01:48:23,504
Give me the key.
Give me the key!

1777
01:48:35,453 --> 01:48:39,253
You motherfucking black bastard!

1778
01:48:39,373 --> 01:48:41,535
You're gonna die
on this mountain,

1779
01:48:41,653 --> 01:48:44,053
and I'm gonna fucking laugh
when you do!

1780
01:48:45,852 --> 01:48:47,502
What'd I say 'bout talkin'?

1781
01:48:47,612 --> 01:48:48,693
Bastard.

1782
01:48:48,812 --> 01:48:51,179
Meant it, didn't I?

1783
01:48:52,372 --> 01:48:53,817
And you need to understand

1784
01:48:53,932 --> 01:48:56,218
you just killed
the only man here

1785
01:48:56,331 --> 01:48:59,460
committed to gettin' you
to Red Rock alive.

1786
01:49:05,251 --> 01:49:07,298
Now, one of y'all...

1787
01:49:07,410 --> 01:49:10,380
is workin' with her.

1788
01:49:10,490 --> 01:49:12,538
Or two of y'all
is workin' with her.

1789
01:49:12,650 --> 01:49:15,301
Or all y'all is.

1790
01:49:17,929 --> 01:49:19,818
But only one of you

1791
01:49:19,929 --> 01:49:21,294
poisoned the coffee.

1792
01:49:25,129 --> 01:49:27,813
Now, what charms this bitch got

1793
01:49:27,928 --> 01:49:30,613
make a man brave a blizzard,

1794
01:49:30,728 --> 01:49:32,571
kill in cold blood?

1795
01:49:34,408 --> 01:49:36,410
I'm sure I don't know.

1796
01:49:40,287 --> 01:49:43,609
But John Ruth's tryin'
to hang your woman.

1797
01:49:43,727 --> 01:49:45,536
So you kill him.

1798
01:49:45,647 --> 01:49:47,456
Okay.

1799
01:49:47,567 --> 01:49:49,569
Maybe.

1800
01:49:49,687 --> 01:49:52,849
But O.B. wasn't hangin' nobody.

1801
01:49:52,966 --> 01:49:54,331
He damn sure wasn't.

1802
01:49:54,446 --> 01:49:55,936
But he sure enough
layin' over there dead

1803
01:49:56,046 --> 01:49:57,172
now, though, ain't he?

1804
01:49:57,286 --> 01:49:59,368
He damn sure is,
you sons of bitches.

1805
01:49:59,486 --> 01:50:02,250
Just like any one of us
would've drunk that coffee.

1806
01:50:02,365 --> 01:50:04,493
Like me, goddamn it.

1807
01:50:04,605 --> 01:50:07,575
Now, those of y'all
with your hands on the wall

1808
01:50:07,685 --> 01:50:08,891
don't practice in poison

1809
01:50:09,005 --> 01:50:10,734
need to think about that.

1810
01:50:12,404 --> 01:50:13,929
Think about how
it could've been you

1811
01:50:14,044 --> 01:50:16,809
rollin' around here
on this floor.

1812
01:50:16,924 --> 01:50:19,370
And how the man standin'
next to you

1813
01:50:19,484 --> 01:50:20,974
would be responsible.

1814
01:50:21,124 --> 01:50:23,569
And I know
who I got my money on.

1815
01:50:23,683 --> 01:50:26,050
Oh, that's right, Joe Gage.

1816
01:50:26,163 --> 01:50:27,528
I'm lookin' at you.

1817
01:50:29,523 --> 01:50:31,924
Not so fast, Chris.

1818
01:50:32,043 --> 01:50:34,205
We'll get there.

1819
01:50:34,322 --> 01:50:37,326
Let's slow it down.

1820
01:50:37,442 --> 01:50:39,888
Let's slow it way down.

1821
01:50:45,401 --> 01:50:47,165
Who made the coffee?

1822
01:50:47,281 --> 01:50:48,885
He did.

1823
01:50:50,921 --> 01:50:52,411
Yeah, he did, didn't he?

1824
01:50:52,521 --> 01:50:55,570
Yeah, he did, didn't he?

1825
01:50:55,681 --> 01:50:58,889
But it's the stew
that's got me thinkin'.

1826
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:03,244
Now, how long you said
Minnie been gone?

1827
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:04,930
A week?

1828
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:07,525
Si.

1829
01:51:08,599 --> 01:51:10,249
See...

1830
01:51:10,359 --> 01:51:13,329
my mama used to make stew,

1831
01:51:13,439 --> 01:51:15,362
and it always tasted the same,

1832
01:51:15,479 --> 01:51:17,004
no matter the meat.

1833
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:19,041
And there was another fellow
on the plantation,

1834
01:51:19,158 --> 01:51:20,683
Uncle Charly.

1835
01:51:20,798 --> 01:51:22,323
He made stew, too.

1836
01:51:22,438 --> 01:51:24,122
And like my mama,

1837
01:51:24,238 --> 01:51:28,129
I ate his stew from the time
I was a whipper

1838
01:51:28,238 --> 01:51:30,638
till I was a full-grown man.

1839
01:51:31,837 --> 01:51:33,760
No matter the meat,

1840
01:51:33,877 --> 01:51:36,721
it always tasted
like Uncle Charly's stew.

1841
01:51:37,997 --> 01:51:39,681
Now, I ain't had Minnie's stew

1842
01:51:39,797 --> 01:51:41,639
in six months,
so I ain't no expert.

1843
01:51:41,756 --> 01:51:45,841
But that damn sure is...

1844
01:51:45,956 --> 01:51:48,641
Minnie's stew.

1845
01:51:48,756 --> 01:51:51,123
So if Minnie
is on the north side

1846
01:51:51,236 --> 01:51:53,715
visitin' her mama for a week,

1847
01:51:53,875 --> 01:51:56,685
how'd she make the stew
this mornin'?

1848
01:51:56,835 --> 01:51:58,360
Hmm.

1849
01:52:00,995 --> 01:52:03,884
And this...

1850
01:52:03,994 --> 01:52:07,794
this is Sweet Dave's chair.

1851
01:52:07,914 --> 01:52:09,962
When I sat in it earlier,

1852
01:52:10,074 --> 01:52:11,883
I couldn't believe it.

1853
01:52:11,994 --> 01:52:14,519
Nobody sits
in Sweet Dave's chair.

1854
01:52:14,633 --> 01:52:16,874
Uh, this may be Minnie's place,

1855
01:52:16,993 --> 01:52:20,281
but this is damn sure.

1856
01:52:20,393 --> 01:52:22,475
Sweet Dave's chair.

1857
01:52:24,793 --> 01:52:27,955
And if he went
to the north side...

1858
01:52:29,712 --> 01:52:31,953
I'm pretty goddamn sure

1859
01:52:32,072 --> 01:52:34,757
this chair be goin' with him.

1860
01:52:39,391 --> 01:52:41,234
What's in the chair?

1861
01:52:41,351 --> 01:52:43,513
Just what I thought.

1862
01:52:43,671 --> 01:52:46,641
Sweet Dave's goddamn blood.

1863
01:52:46,751 --> 01:52:48,400
<i>Hoo!</i>

1864
01:52:48,550 --> 01:52:50,234
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

1865
01:52:52,350 --> 01:52:56,674
So, are you actually
accusing me of murder?

1866
01:52:59,869 --> 01:53:02,839
Way I see it, Senor Bob,

1867
01:53:02,949 --> 01:53:06,112
is whoever is workin' with her

1868
01:53:06,229 --> 01:53:09,073
ain't who they say they is.

1869
01:53:09,189 --> 01:53:11,031
And if it's you,

1870
01:53:11,148 --> 01:53:13,276
that means Minnie and her man

1871
01:53:13,388 --> 01:53:15,231
ain't at her mama's.

1872
01:53:15,348 --> 01:53:18,830
They layin' out back there
dead somewhere.

1873
01:53:18,948 --> 01:53:20,995
Or if it's you,
little British man,

1874
01:53:21,107 --> 01:53:24,316
the real Oswaldo Mobray layin'
in a ditch somewhere

1875
01:53:24,427 --> 01:53:26,953
and you just a English fella
passin' off his papers.

1876
01:53:27,067 --> 01:53:29,832
Or we go by my theory,

1877
01:53:29,947 --> 01:53:32,870
which is the ugliest guy did it.

1878
01:53:32,986 --> 01:53:35,557
Which makes it you, Joe Gage.

1879
01:53:35,666 --> 01:53:39,955
So I take it you deduced
the coffee was poisoned

1880
01:53:40,066 --> 01:53:42,034
while you were murdering
the old man?

1881
01:53:43,225 --> 01:53:44,875
Yes.

1882
01:53:44,985 --> 01:53:47,511
Well, mi negro amigo,

1883
01:53:47,625 --> 01:53:49,787
during that whole incident,

1884
01:53:49,905 --> 01:53:52,511
I was sitting on that side
of the room

1885
01:53:52,625 --> 01:53:54,831
playing "Silent Night"
on the piano.

1886
01:53:54,984 --> 01:53:57,988
Oh, I ain't say
you poisoned the coffee.

1887
01:53:58,104 --> 01:54:01,074
I said you didn't make the stew.

1888
01:54:02,584 --> 01:54:06,065
My theory is...

1889
01:54:06,183 --> 01:54:09,187
you workin' with the man

1890
01:54:09,303 --> 01:54:10,987
who poisoned the coffee,

1891
01:54:11,103 --> 01:54:13,504
and both of y'all
murdered Minnie,

1892
01:54:13,623 --> 01:54:16,546
Sweet Dave and whoever else
picked this bad-luck day

1893
01:54:16,662 --> 01:54:19,506
to visit Minnie's Haberdashery
this mornin'.

1894
01:54:19,622 --> 01:54:23,388
And at some point,
y'all intended

1895
01:54:23,502 --> 01:54:25,982
to bushwhack John Ruth

1896
01:54:26,102 --> 01:54:28,866
and free Daisy.

1897
01:54:28,981 --> 01:54:31,427
But you didn't count
on the blizzard,

1898
01:54:31,541 --> 01:54:34,590
and you didn't count on
the two of us.

1899
01:54:34,701 --> 01:54:35,862
Hmm.

1900
01:54:39,260 --> 01:54:41,228
That's far as I got.
How am I doing?

1901
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:47,586
You're a real
imaginative nigger,

1902
01:54:47,740 --> 01:54:49,946
ain't you?

1903
01:54:50,059 --> 01:54:52,903
So, do you intend to murder me

1904
01:54:53,019 --> 01:54:55,340
based on a far-fetched
nigger theory,

1905
01:54:55,499 --> 01:54:57,866
or can you prove it, cabron?

1906
01:54:59,419 --> 01:55:04,549
It ain't so far-fetched,
Senor Bob.

1907
01:55:04,658 --> 01:55:07,423
And it's a little bit more
than a theory.

1908
01:55:11,777 --> 01:55:14,348
How long you say
you been workin' for Minnie?

1909
01:55:14,457 --> 01:55:16,221
Four months.

1910
01:55:16,337 --> 01:55:18,066
Mmm.

1911
01:55:18,177 --> 01:55:20,862
See, if you'd have been here
two and a half years ago,

1912
01:55:20,977 --> 01:55:24,822
you'd know 'bout that sign
used to hang up over the bar.

1913
01:55:24,936 --> 01:55:27,382
Minnie mention that to you?

1914
01:55:28,696 --> 01:55:30,539
No.

1915
01:55:30,696 --> 01:55:33,461
You want to know what
that sign said, Senor Bob?

1916
01:55:35,615 --> 01:55:39,904
"No dogs or Mexicans allowed. "

1917
01:55:43,415 --> 01:55:44,860
Now, Minnie hung that sign up

1918
01:55:44,974 --> 01:55:46,976
the day she opened
this haberdashery.

1919
01:55:47,094 --> 01:55:50,064
And it hung over that bar
every day

1920
01:55:50,214 --> 01:55:53,184
till she took it down
a little over two years ago.

1921
01:55:54,774 --> 01:55:56,537
You know why she took it down?

1922
01:55:58,413 --> 01:56:00,939
She started lettin' in dogs.

1923
01:56:04,613 --> 01:56:08,583
Now, Minnie liked
just about everybody,

1924
01:56:08,732 --> 01:56:10,860
but she sure don't

1925
01:56:10,972 --> 01:56:12,815
like Mexicans.

1926
01:56:12,932 --> 01:56:14,855
So when you tell me.

1927
01:56:14,972 --> 01:56:18,532
Minnie went to the north side
to visit her mama,

1928
01:56:18,651 --> 01:56:21,222
<i>well, I find that
highly unlikely.</i>

1929
01:56:21,331 --> 01:56:24,619
But okay, maybe.

1930
01:56:24,731 --> 01:56:27,337
But when you tell me.

1931
01:56:27,451 --> 01:56:31,091
Minnie Mink
took the haberdashery,

1932
01:56:31,250 --> 01:56:35,175
the most precious thing to her
in the whole world,

1933
01:56:35,290 --> 01:56:39,261
and left it in the hands
of a goddamn Mexican?

1934
01:56:40,729 --> 01:56:42,379
Well, that's what I meant
in the barn

1935
01:56:42,489 --> 01:56:45,220
when I said that sure
don't sound like Minnie.

1936
01:56:47,289 --> 01:56:50,293
Now I am calling you a liar,

1937
01:56:50,409 --> 01:56:52,376
Senor Bob.

1938
01:56:53,648 --> 01:56:55,650
And if you lyin',

1939
01:56:55,768 --> 01:56:57,258
which you are...

1940
01:56:58,888 --> 01:56:59,928
then you killed Minnie.

1941
01:56:59,968 --> 01:57:01,891
And Sweet Dave.

1942
01:57:20,326 --> 01:57:22,727
Four measly bullets,

1943
01:57:22,846 --> 01:57:25,974
and there goes Senor Bob.

1944
01:57:27,605 --> 01:57:30,927
But that still
don't get us no closer

1945
01:57:31,045 --> 01:57:34,413
to which one of y'all
poisoned the coffee, though.

1946
01:57:34,525 --> 01:57:35,572
Do it, Chris?

1947
01:57:35,725 --> 01:57:37,692
No, it sure don't.

1948
01:57:43,724 --> 01:57:46,045
Now, one of y'all
poisoned this coffee

1949
01:57:46,164 --> 01:57:47,574
to free Daisy.

1950
01:57:47,683 --> 01:57:49,367
If I don't hear a confession

1951
01:57:49,483 --> 01:57:52,612
from one of you motherfuckers
quick, fast and in a hurry,

1952
01:57:52,723 --> 01:57:55,294
I'm gonna pour
this whole pot of coffee

1953
01:57:55,403 --> 01:57:58,009
down that bitch's
goddamn throat.

1954
01:57:59,322 --> 01:58:02,485
Okay. Time's up.

1955
01:58:02,602 --> 01:58:03,888
Stop!

1956
01:58:04,042 --> 01:58:05,931
All right, I did it.

1957
01:58:06,042 --> 01:58:07,965
It was me.
I poisoned the coffee.

1958
01:58:09,082 --> 01:58:12,051
I fuckin' knew it!

1959
01:58:12,161 --> 01:58:13,606
Oh!

1960
01:58:13,761 --> 01:58:16,128
You gonna die now,
you murderin' bastard!

1961
01:58:16,241 --> 01:58:19,290
Major Warren,
please let me send this ugly

1962
01:58:19,401 --> 01:58:21,289
son of a bitch to hell.

1963
01:58:21,400 --> 01:58:23,209
You killed O.B.

1964
01:58:23,320 --> 01:58:24,924
He was worth ten of you.

1965
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:26,724
Warren, can I kill him?

1966
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:28,046
Say adios to your huevos.

1967
01:58:35,559 --> 01:58:38,324
Major Warren!

1968
01:58:55,437 --> 01:58:58,680
I ain't got no gun,

1969
01:58:58,797 --> 01:59:01,243
Sheriff.

1970
01:59:35,834 --> 01:59:37,199
Roy!

1971
01:59:37,314 --> 01:59:38,917
Good boy.

1972
01:59:42,793 --> 01:59:44,318
Get up!

1973
01:59:44,433 --> 01:59:45,559
Get up there!

1974
01:59:45,673 --> 01:59:46,799
Get up!

1975
01:59:46,913 --> 01:59:49,563
Packer, Roy, get up!

1976
01:59:49,672 --> 01:59:51,276
Get up!

1977
01:59:51,432 --> 01:59:52,792
Get up there! Get up!

1978
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:53,958
Get up!

1979
01:59:54,072 --> 01:59:55,312
Get up there! Get up!

1980
01:59:55,432 --> 01:59:57,002
Get up!

1981
01:59:57,112 --> 01:59:58,318
Go!

1982
02:00:00,671 --> 02:00:04,118
Go! Go! Go!

1983
02:00:04,231 --> 02:00:06,552
GO! Go!

1984
02:00:08,671 --> 02:00:10,036
Go!

1985
02:01:11,065 --> 02:01:12,635
Get up. Get up.

1986
02:01:12,745 --> 02:01:14,873
- Hyah! Get up! Get up!
- Get up!

1987
02:01:14,985 --> 02:01:16,032
Get up!

1988
02:01:16,145 --> 02:01:17,749
Get up!

1989
02:01:26,424 --> 02:01:27,664
Get up!

1990
02:01:27,784 --> 02:01:30,184
Get up!

1991
02:01:33,823 --> 02:01:35,427
Get up! Get up!

1992
02:01:51,701 --> 02:01:52,987
- Whoa!
- Easy.

1993
02:01:53,101 --> 02:01:54,227
- Whoa.
- Whoa!

1994
02:01:54,381 --> 02:01:56,270
Whoa. Hey, Charly, my boy.

1995
02:01:56,421 --> 02:01:57,468
How the hell are you?

1996
02:01:57,581 --> 02:01:58,992
Hiya, Ed. Hiya, Judy.

1997
02:01:59,101 --> 02:02:00,512
Yeah!

1998
02:02:01,741 --> 02:02:02,707
Ah.

1999
02:02:02,820 --> 02:02:03,981
How many you got?

2000
02:02:04,100 --> 02:02:05,147
Full house today, friend.

2001
02:02:05,260 --> 02:02:06,750
Got one in there waitin'.

2002
02:02:06,860 --> 02:02:08,225
Well, he's gonna have
to keep on waitin'.

2003
02:02:08,340 --> 02:02:09,341
We ain't got no room.

2004
02:02:09,460 --> 02:02:10,791
Well, you need to tell Minnie.

2005
02:02:10,900 --> 02:02:12,186
'Cause he been here two days,

2006
02:02:12,300 --> 02:02:13,824
and Minnie wants him
out of here.

2007
02:02:13,979 --> 02:02:15,822
Well, I can't give him
a seat I don't have.

2008
02:02:15,979 --> 02:02:18,459
Listen, why don't you take
the passengers inside

2009
02:02:18,579 --> 02:02:19,944
and introduce 'em to Minnie,

2010
02:02:20,059 --> 02:02:21,424
warm yourself up
and drink some coffee.

2011
02:02:21,539 --> 02:02:22,620
Yeah.

2012
02:02:27,898 --> 02:02:29,627
Here we are, everybody.

2013
02:02:29,738 --> 02:02:31,069
Minnie's Haberdashery.

2014
02:02:31,178 --> 02:02:32,339
Step outside,
you and your friends

2015
02:02:32,498 --> 02:02:33,704
can stretch your legs.

2016
02:02:33,818 --> 02:02:35,149
When you're ready,
step on inside,

2017
02:02:35,258 --> 02:02:37,464
get warm by the fire,
get some coffee in you.

2018
02:02:37,577 --> 02:02:39,386
I'll introduce you to Minnie.

2019
02:02:42,577 --> 02:02:45,262
Hiya, Minnie!

2020
02:03:02,975 --> 02:03:04,739
Now, Minnie,
I'm not tryin' to tell you

2021
02:03:04,855 --> 02:03:06,815
how to run your business,
but I would think coffee

2022
02:03:06,895 --> 02:03:09,135
would be the first thing you'd make.
Hmm.

2023
02:03:09,254 --> 02:03:10,654
Come on in, everybody.
Don't be shy.

2024
02:03:10,734 --> 02:03:12,179
Hats!

2025
02:03:12,294 --> 02:03:14,661
Everybody, this is Minnie,
and this is her place.

2026
02:03:14,774 --> 02:03:17,983
Behind me, pluckin'
that chicken, is Gemma.

2027
02:03:18,094 --> 02:03:19,141
Ah.

2028
02:03:19,254 --> 02:03:21,620
Lovely smile, that Gemma.

2029
02:03:21,733 --> 02:03:23,497
Now, the fella in the uniform
I don't know,

2030
02:03:23,613 --> 02:03:25,615
but the one he's playing chess
with is Sweet Dave.

2031
02:03:25,733 --> 02:03:26,894
Hiya, Dave.

2032
02:03:27,013 --> 02:03:28,981
Hey, Judy.

2033
02:03:29,133 --> 02:03:30,658
And, Minnie,

2034
02:03:30,773 --> 02:03:32,217
these are the passengers.

2035
02:03:32,332 --> 02:03:34,221
Well, that's not good enough.

2036
02:03:34,332 --> 02:03:36,175
Go on, take away them rags,

2037
02:03:36,292 --> 02:03:38,533
let's see some faces,
let's hear some names.

2038
02:03:38,652 --> 02:03:41,258
Oswaldo Mobray, madam.

2039
02:03:41,372 --> 02:03:42,657
Joe Gage.

2040
02:03:42,811 --> 02:03:44,893
Bob.

2041
02:03:45,011 --> 02:03:46,615
And I'm Jody.

2042
02:03:46,771 --> 02:03:49,377
It's a pleasant surprise
to find such a warm sanctuary

2043
02:03:49,491 --> 02:03:51,698
in the middle
of such a cold hell.

2044
02:03:51,811 --> 02:03:53,335
Well, make yourself comfortable.

2045
02:03:53,450 --> 02:03:54,736
Get warm by the fire.

2046
02:03:54,850 --> 02:03:56,898
Uh, we're just gonna go
warm ourselves

2047
02:03:57,010 --> 02:03:58,660
by the stove,
if that's all right.

2048
02:03:58,770 --> 02:04:00,534
Oh, stove, fireplace, whatever.

2049
02:04:00,650 --> 02:04:01,651
Just get warm.

2050
02:04:01,770 --> 02:04:03,010
Oh, and Judy said somethin'

2051
02:04:03,130 --> 02:04:04,893
about the best coffee
in the world.

2052
02:04:05,009 --> 02:04:07,011
Ah, yes. I do believe Judy
did say something

2053
02:04:07,129 --> 02:04:09,450
about the best coffee
in the world.

2054
02:04:09,569 --> 02:04:10,900
Well, I don't know
about all that,

2055
02:04:11,009 --> 02:04:12,579
but I tell you what it is.

2056
02:04:12,689 --> 02:04:14,214
It's hot, it's strong,
and it's good.

2057
02:04:14,329 --> 02:04:15,534
And in this here snow,

2058
02:04:15,648 --> 02:04:17,298
it sure enough warms
your ass up.

2059
02:04:17,408 --> 02:04:19,729
You don't need to sell it,
Minnie, you need to make it.

2060
02:04:19,888 --> 02:04:21,413
And you need to get
your ass out there

2061
02:04:21,528 --> 02:04:23,610
and help Charly with them bags
and get Ed in here.

2062
02:04:23,728 --> 02:04:25,457
Yes, ma'am.

2063
02:04:25,568 --> 02:04:27,569
<i>- But fix that coffee.
- I'll fix you!</i>

2064
02:04:30,047 --> 02:04:31,697
I don't know, some old man.

2065
02:04:31,807 --> 02:04:33,935
Well, I don't know what
I'm supposed to do about it.

2066
02:04:34,047 --> 02:04:35,970
I'm just telling you
what she said.

2067
02:04:36,087 --> 02:04:37,895
Anyway, she sent me out here
to help Charly.

2068
02:04:38,006 --> 02:04:40,486
She wants to talk to you.

2069
02:04:40,606 --> 02:04:42,256
Charly, you got a hold
of these fellas?

2070
02:04:42,406 --> 02:04:43,931
Got 'em, Ed.

2071
02:05:00,404 --> 02:05:03,567
Miss Minnie,
would you roll me a cigarette?

2072
02:05:03,684 --> 02:05:05,095
Sure, honey.

2073
02:05:05,204 --> 02:05:06,569
I smoke Red Apple tobacco.

2074
02:05:06,684 --> 02:05:07,606
That all right?

2075
02:05:07,764 --> 02:05:09,732
That's my favorite.

2076
02:05:12,723 --> 02:05:15,488
Don't mind me, gentlemen.

2077
02:05:15,643 --> 02:05:18,089
I'm just watching.

2078
02:05:18,203 --> 02:05:20,888
You play?

2079
02:05:21,003 --> 02:05:25,132
You know, I must have had
at least 12 people

2080
02:05:25,242 --> 02:05:27,609
teach me that goddamn game.

2081
02:05:27,722 --> 02:05:31,090
Just never could keep
the moves in my head.

2082
02:05:32,522 --> 02:05:34,171
But if I'm not disturbing,

2083
02:05:34,281 --> 02:05:35,442
I'd like to watch.

2084
02:05:35,561 --> 02:05:36,972
Hell no. I like whippin'

2085
02:05:37,121 --> 02:05:38,850
this old man's ass
in front of a audience.

2086
02:05:39,001 --> 02:05:41,368
You ain't whippin' shit!

2087
02:05:43,081 --> 02:05:45,606
Merci beaucoup,
Mademoiselle Minnie.

2088
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:47,165
Oh, that's real nice.

2089
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:48,691
What is that?

2090
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:50,001
That's French.

2091
02:05:50,120 --> 02:05:51,804
You speak French?

2092
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:53,285
Oui.

2093
02:05:53,400 --> 02:05:55,640
"Oui"? What does that mean?

2094
02:05:55,759 --> 02:05:57,488
It means "yes. "

2095
02:05:57,639 --> 02:05:59,880
Oui, yes.

2096
02:05:59,999 --> 02:06:03,481
Hey, hey, Dave,
ask me if my ass is fat.

2097
02:06:03,599 --> 02:06:04,646
What?

2098
02:06:04,759 --> 02:06:06,363
Ask me if my ass is fat.

2099
02:06:06,478 --> 02:06:07,764
It is.

2100
02:06:07,878 --> 02:06:09,528
I said ask me.

2101
02:06:09,638 --> 02:06:10,844
Why?

2102
02:06:10,958 --> 02:06:12,722
Just do it!

2103
02:06:12,838 --> 02:06:14,681
Is your ass fat?

2104
02:06:14,798 --> 02:06:16,243
Oui.

2105
02:06:16,358 --> 02:06:18,485
Look at that, y'all,
I can speak French.

2106
02:06:56,314 --> 02:06:58,203
Are you the, uh,

2107
02:06:58,314 --> 02:06:59,725
jelly bean salesman around here?

2108
02:07:01,394 --> 02:07:03,680
How many peppermint sticks
I get for a nickel?

2109
02:07:03,793 --> 02:07:05,795
Five.

2110
02:07:05,953 --> 02:07:07,921
All right.

2111
02:07:10,313 --> 02:07:12,520
- Here you go.
- Thank you, sugar.

2112
02:07:12,633 --> 02:07:14,600
Okay.

2113
02:07:21,872 --> 02:07:25,000
Uh, allow me
to assist you, madam.

2114
02:07:45,350 --> 02:07:46,999
I'm bringing in your bags

2115
02:07:47,109 --> 02:07:49,509
in case anybody wants to change
your clothes before Red Rock.

2116
02:07:49,589 --> 02:07:51,114
Oh.

2117
02:07:59,588 --> 02:08:02,398
Peppermint stick?

2118
02:08:06,708 --> 02:08:08,755
Thanks.

2119
02:08:11,867 --> 02:08:14,552
So why do they call you
"Six-Horse Judy" anyway?

2120
02:08:16,267 --> 02:08:17,917
'Cause I'm the only Judy
you've ever seen

2121
02:08:18,027 --> 02:08:20,472
that can drive a six-horse team.

2122
02:08:20,586 --> 02:08:21,792
Oh, yeah.

2123
02:08:23,306 --> 02:08:25,593
Kind of a stupid question.

2124
02:08:27,586 --> 02:08:29,270
Do you mind holding this for me?

2125
02:08:29,386 --> 02:08:31,114
Ah...

2126
02:08:31,225 --> 02:08:33,956
rock steady, madam.

2127
02:08:34,065 --> 02:08:36,716
Rock steady.

2128
02:08:36,825 --> 02:08:40,910
You got a very sweet
little accent.

2129
02:08:41,025 --> 02:08:42,947
Where's that from, England?

2130
02:08:43,064 --> 02:08:44,634
I take exception to that.

2131
02:08:46,304 --> 02:08:48,784
- New Zealand.
- Careful, madam. Precarious.

2132
02:08:48,904 --> 02:08:50,474
Ls that anywhere near,
uh, Old Zealand?

2133
02:09:11,062 --> 02:09:12,393
Mmm.

2134
02:09:13,422 --> 02:09:14,833
Auckland?

2135
02:09:14,942 --> 02:09:16,750
What the fuck's an Auckland?

2136
02:09:16,861 --> 02:09:18,431
It's where I'm from.

2137
02:09:18,541 --> 02:09:20,111
It's our biggest city.

2138
02:09:20,221 --> 02:09:21,711
- Coffee!
- Mm-hmm.

2139
02:09:22,941 --> 02:09:24,306
Coffee's ready.

2140
02:09:24,421 --> 02:09:26,229
Well, it's about damn time!

2141
02:09:28,260 --> 02:09:30,103
Best coffee on the mountain.

2142
02:09:30,220 --> 02:09:32,427
Oh, I don't know about all that.

2143
02:09:32,540 --> 02:09:35,828
Stagecoach drivers like it,
passengers not so much.

2144
02:09:35,940 --> 02:09:38,260
Most find it a mite too strong.

2145
02:09:38,379 --> 02:09:40,268
Can't be too strong
on this mountain.

2146
02:09:40,379 --> 02:09:41,619
Thank you.

2147
02:09:46,819 --> 02:09:48,264
Well?

2148
02:09:48,378 --> 02:09:49,948
What do you think?

2149
02:10:12,696 --> 02:10:13,777
Shit, fuck!

2150
02:10:16,256 --> 02:10:17,781
Shit!

2151
02:10:39,654 --> 02:10:40,894
Yep.

2152
02:10:51,293 --> 02:10:53,421
- Mmm, si.
- He adds something.

2153
02:10:53,533 --> 02:10:54,977
Not much, but something.

2154
02:10:57,012 --> 02:10:58,457
What you think, Pete?

2155
02:11:02,772 --> 02:11:04,297
Well, I must admit,

2156
02:11:04,412 --> 02:11:07,221
he does make the setup
more convincing.

2157
02:11:08,531 --> 02:11:09,657
Hmm.

2158
02:11:09,771 --> 02:11:11,011
Okay.

2159
02:11:11,131 --> 02:11:12,701
I'll talk to the old man.

2160
02:11:12,811 --> 02:11:14,097
You three collect the bodies

2161
02:11:14,211 --> 02:11:16,020
and chuck 'em
in that well out there.

2162
02:11:17,530 --> 02:11:19,339
And then start
unhitchin' the horses

2163
02:11:19,450 --> 02:11:21,330
and gettin' 'em in the barn
and gettin' 'em fed.

2164
02:11:21,370 --> 02:11:23,338
Well, hang on. I mean,
puttin' the horses away,

2165
02:11:23,450 --> 02:11:25,134
that's easy enough,

2166
02:11:25,250 --> 02:11:27,173
but draggin' these fat bastards
up and down the mountain,

2167
02:11:27,290 --> 02:11:28,256
that's fuckin' impossible, mate.

2168
02:11:28,369 --> 02:11:30,019
Okay.

2169
02:11:30,129 --> 02:11:32,496
Well, this is a store,
so there's gotta be

2170
02:11:32,609 --> 02:11:34,134
a wheelbarrow
around here somewhere.

2171
02:11:34,249 --> 02:11:36,013
Start with the horses,

2172
02:11:36,129 --> 02:11:40,019
and as soon as I get through
with this old hickory tree,

2173
02:11:40,128 --> 02:11:42,335
I'll come out
and help you, okay?

2174
02:11:49,128 --> 02:11:51,528
Hey, Pete,
grab my coat, will ya?

2175
02:12:08,886 --> 02:12:10,809
<i>Now</i>

2176
02:12:10,926 --> 02:12:12,768
<i>You're all</i>

2177
02:12:12,885 --> 02:12:15,729
<i>Alone</i>

2178
02:12:18,245 --> 02:12:20,054
<i>Feelin'</i>

2179
02:12:20,165 --> 02:12:24,055
<i>That nobody wants you</i>

2180
02:12:27,204 --> 02:12:29,650
<i>And you're looking</i>

2181
02:12:29,764 --> 02:12:32,290
<i>For someone</i>

2182
02:12:32,404 --> 02:12:37,011
<i>To hold your hand</i>

2183
02:12:37,123 --> 02:12:39,888
<i>Someone</i>

2184
02:12:40,003 --> 02:12:44,691
<i>Who understands</i>

2185
02:12:47,962 --> 02:12:49,566
<i>Now</i>

2186
02:12:49,722 --> 02:12:53,522
<i>You're by yourself</i>

2187
02:12:55,762 --> 02:12:59,322
<i>And you're feelin'</i>

2188
02:12:59,481 --> 02:13:02,325
<i>The world close</i>

2189
02:13:02,441 --> 02:13:04,967
<i>In on you</i>

2190
02:13:06,281 --> 02:13:08,521
<i>And you're askin'...</i>

2191
02:13:08,640 --> 02:13:10,642
Look.

2192
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:12,444
I just started workin' here.

2193
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:14,528
Whatever Minnie did
to make y'all mad...

2194
02:13:15,800 --> 02:13:17,643
I had nothin' to do with it.

2195
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:19,329
<i>Someone...</i>

2196
02:13:26,559 --> 02:13:28,527
Hmm.

2197
02:13:29,799 --> 02:13:32,449
Well, old man.

2198
02:13:34,158 --> 02:13:35,842
If you...

2199
02:13:35,958 --> 02:13:37,562
was a cat,

2200
02:13:37,678 --> 02:13:40,488
what just happened here

2201
02:13:40,598 --> 02:13:42,838
would count as one
of your nine lives.

2202
02:13:45,557 --> 02:13:48,128
Do you realize
how close you came

2203
02:13:48,277 --> 02:13:50,166
to being tossed
on a pile of niggers?

2204
02:13:50,277 --> 02:13:51,802
- Yes.
- Yeah.

2205
02:13:51,917 --> 02:13:53,805
And when it comes
to that pile of niggers

2206
02:13:53,916 --> 02:13:55,725
that we buildin' out back,

2207
02:13:55,836 --> 02:13:57,725
won't take nothin'
to make you general of it.

2208
02:13:57,836 --> 02:13:59,998
You believe that?

2209
02:14:00,116 --> 02:14:02,357
I expect no less.

2210
02:14:02,476 --> 02:14:05,718
Not so fast, old man.

2211
02:14:05,875 --> 02:14:07,877
You might have
a way out of this yet.

2212
02:14:11,075 --> 02:14:14,284
Later today,

2213
02:14:14,395 --> 02:14:16,442
dirty...

2214
02:14:16,594 --> 02:14:19,165
son of a gun

2215
02:14:19,274 --> 02:14:21,481
is gonna come in here...

2216
02:14:25,114 --> 02:14:28,003
and he's gonna have
my sister with him.

2217
02:14:28,113 --> 02:14:31,674
And he is gonna
have her in chains.

2218
02:14:34,713 --> 02:14:37,841
He's taking her to Red Rock
to be hung.

2219
02:14:47,991 --> 02:14:50,232
Do you know why?

2220
02:14:50,351 --> 02:14:52,718
No.

2221
02:14:55,751 --> 02:14:57,879
$10,000.

2222
02:14:59,950 --> 02:15:03,113
That's why.

2223
02:15:03,230 --> 02:15:05,153
Now, when he gets here,

2224
02:15:05,270 --> 02:15:09,639
I'm gonna kill that fella
and turn my sister loose.

2225
02:15:09,750 --> 02:15:13,640
Now, do you have any reason
why you would want to interfere

2226
02:15:13,749 --> 02:15:16,719
with me saving my sister
from a hangman's rope?

2227
02:15:16,829 --> 02:15:17,876
No.

2228
02:15:17,989 --> 02:15:19,150
You don't?

2229
02:15:19,269 --> 02:15:20,430
No, I don't.

2230
02:15:20,549 --> 02:15:22,038
You sure you don't?

2231
02:15:22,148 --> 02:15:25,231
I mean, we did just kill
Minnie and Sweet Dave.

2232
02:15:26,348 --> 02:15:27,759
Now, you and Sweet Dave looked

2233
02:15:27,908 --> 02:15:29,148
mighty chummy over here.

2234
02:15:29,268 --> 02:15:30,429
I just met these people!

2235
02:15:30,548 --> 02:15:32,152
I don't give a damn about them!

2236
02:15:32,268 --> 02:15:34,508
Or you. Or your sister.

2237
02:15:34,667 --> 02:15:37,910
Or any other son of a bitch
in Wyoming, for that matter.

2238
02:15:38,027 --> 02:15:41,429
That is a good answer,

2239
02:15:41,587 --> 02:15:44,032
old man.

2240
02:15:44,146 --> 02:15:46,308
Now, when they get here,

2241
02:15:46,466 --> 02:15:49,470
you just sit your ass
in this chair,

2242
02:15:49,586 --> 02:15:51,748
and you don't do nothin'.

2243
02:15:51,866 --> 02:15:53,072
You don't say nothin'.

2244
02:15:53,226 --> 02:15:54,307
"Hello. "

2245
02:15:54,426 --> 02:15:55,347
"Thank you. "

2246
02:15:55,465 --> 02:15:56,466
"Good night. "

2247
02:15:56,585 --> 02:15:57,791
That's about it.

2248
02:15:57,905 --> 02:16:00,829
Maybe your name.

2249
02:16:00,945 --> 02:16:02,071
But that's it.

2250
02:16:02,185 --> 02:16:03,675
"Hello. "

2251
02:16:03,785 --> 02:16:04,786
"Thank you. "

2252
02:16:04,945 --> 02:16:06,753
"Good night. "

2253
02:16:06,904 --> 02:16:09,271
- And maybe my name.
- Maybe your name.

2254
02:16:09,384 --> 02:16:12,433
Mm-hmm, be a, be a old man.

2255
02:16:12,544 --> 02:16:13,955
Be dotty.

2256
02:16:14,064 --> 02:16:16,226
Go to sleep.

2257
02:16:16,344 --> 02:16:18,994
And don't you say nothin',

2258
02:16:19,103 --> 02:16:21,185
and I mean nothin',

2259
02:16:21,303 --> 02:16:23,192
to that bounty hunter
that's got my sister.

2260
02:16:23,303 --> 02:16:24,953
Do you understand?

2261
02:16:25,063 --> 02:16:26,269
Yes.

2262
02:16:28,462 --> 02:16:31,511
When it's Safe, I'll kill him,

2263
02:16:31,622 --> 02:16:33,067
free my sister

2264
02:16:33,182 --> 02:16:35,583
and leave you be.

2265
02:16:37,982 --> 02:16:39,949
Deal?

2266
02:16:43,821 --> 02:16:45,585
Deal.

2267
02:16:45,701 --> 02:16:47,305
Thank you.

2268
02:16:48,701 --> 02:16:50,304
During the next four hours,

2269
02:16:50,420 --> 02:16:52,548
Jody and the boys chucked
the bodies down the well...

2270
02:16:55,980 --> 02:16:57,982
put away the horses...

2271
02:17:00,340 --> 02:17:02,068
tidied up around Minnie's...

2272
02:17:04,339 --> 02:17:06,387
stashed weapons
for further use...

2273
02:17:10,779 --> 02:17:14,339
and waited for John Ruth
and Daisy's stage to arrive.

2274
02:17:16,778 --> 02:17:18,348
All right, boys.

2275
02:17:18,458 --> 02:17:19,983
This is it.

2276
02:17:20,138 --> 02:17:21,822
Let's get ready.

2277
02:17:27,537 --> 02:17:29,380
Now, remember,

2278
02:17:29,497 --> 02:17:32,068
it doesn't matter
if we have four men or 40,

2279
02:17:32,177 --> 02:17:33,941
we are still
gonna be facing John Ruth

2280
02:17:34,057 --> 02:17:35,262
chained to my sister

2281
02:17:35,376 --> 02:17:36,946
with a pistol pointed
at her belly.

2282
02:17:37,056 --> 02:17:38,706
Now, killin' that fella

2283
02:17:38,816 --> 02:17:40,944
'fore he kills my sister
ain't gonna be easy,

2284
02:17:41,056 --> 02:17:43,821
but you better believe that's
exactly what we gonna do.

2285
02:17:43,936 --> 02:17:47,144
So the name of the game here
is patience.

2286
02:17:47,255 --> 02:17:49,656
Trapped here
for two or three days,

2287
02:17:49,775 --> 02:17:52,506
at some point
he will close his eyes.

2288
02:17:52,615 --> 02:17:55,300
And that's when you blow
the top of his head off.

2289
02:17:55,415 --> 02:17:57,223
Remember, old man.

2290
02:17:57,334 --> 02:17:59,985
If my sister don't make it
off of this mountain alive,

2291
02:18:00,134 --> 02:18:01,295
neither do you.

2292
02:18:01,414 --> 02:18:02,939
I'll do my best.

2293
02:18:10,493 --> 02:18:13,940
Whoa, whoa, easy.

2294
02:18:14,053 --> 02:18:17,136
Whoa. Whoa.

2295
02:18:19,812 --> 02:18:21,143
Good luck, mate.

2296
02:18:33,611 --> 02:18:35,739
What the hell is going on?

2297
02:18:35,851 --> 02:18:37,979
We weren't expecting
another stage tonight!

2298
02:18:38,091 --> 02:18:39,741
- Yeah, I can see you.
- Here.

2299
02:18:39,851 --> 02:18:41,210
Already got another one
up in here.

2300
02:18:41,290 --> 02:18:42,735
No.

2301
02:18:42,850 --> 02:18:45,171
Just got through
puttin' the horses away!

2302
02:18:45,290 --> 02:18:47,691
Well, this ain't
the normal line.

2303
02:18:47,810 --> 02:18:49,892
But we are stuck on
the wrong side of a blizzard,

2304
02:18:50,050 --> 02:18:51,530
so it looks like
you're stuck with us.

2305
02:18:51,570 --> 02:18:52,730
Now you gotta do another one.

2306
02:18:52,889 --> 02:18:55,256
Are Minnie
and Sweet Dave inside?

2307
02:18:55,369 --> 02:18:56,894
They ain't here!

2308
02:18:57,009 --> 02:19:00,013
I'm running the place
while they're gone.

2309
02:19:00,129 --> 02:19:02,336
Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?

2310
02:19:02,449 --> 02:19:05,019
He says they ain't here.

2311
02:19:05,128 --> 02:19:07,415
He's looking after the place
while they're gone.

2312
02:19:07,568 --> 02:19:09,297
Who are you?

2313
02:19:11,128 --> 02:19:14,449
I'm Bob.

2314
02:19:14,567 --> 02:19:19,050
Well, whoever you are,
help O.B. with the horses.

2315
02:19:21,127 --> 02:19:24,017
Get 'em out of this cold
'fore that blizzard hits us.

2316
02:19:24,167 --> 02:19:26,407
Whoa. You all right?

2317
02:19:26,526 --> 02:19:27,937
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

2318
02:19:28,086 --> 02:19:29,690
Esperate, esperate, esperate!

2319
02:19:29,806 --> 02:19:32,650
I just put
those other horses away.

2320
02:19:32,766 --> 02:19:35,292
You need it done fast,
you need to help.

2321
02:19:35,406 --> 02:19:37,806
I got two of my best men on it.

2322
02:19:39,325 --> 02:19:41,089
You heard him, freeloaders.

2323
02:19:41,205 --> 02:19:42,889
Get to work.

2324
02:19:43,005 --> 02:19:46,248
All right, you two,
unhook the leaders.

2325
02:19:46,365 --> 02:19:49,129
Come on, let's go!

2326
02:19:49,244 --> 02:19:50,689
Open up!

2327
02:19:50,804 --> 02:19:52,374
- You have to kick it open!
- Ya gotta kick it open!

2328
02:19:52,524 --> 02:19:54,208
- What?
- Kick it open!

2329
02:20:26,721 --> 02:20:28,644
How you doin', old boy?

2330
02:20:29,961 --> 02:20:32,042
They shot my nuts off.

2331
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:35,084
I'm freezin',
burnin' up the same time.

2332
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:37,965
Bleedin' like a stuck pig.

2333
02:20:38,080 --> 02:20:40,686
I think I'm gonna die.

2334
02:20:40,800 --> 02:20:42,768
And these motherfuckers did it.

2335
02:20:45,239 --> 02:20:47,048
That's how I'm doin'.

2336
02:20:47,199 --> 02:20:48,769
How you doin'?

2337
02:20:49,919 --> 02:20:53,162
Well, my leg hurts really bad.

2338
02:20:53,279 --> 02:20:56,487
But I think, if I put all
my weight on my right foot...

2339
02:20:56,598 --> 02:20:58,043
I was just bein' sarcastic.

2340
02:20:58,158 --> 02:21:00,047
I don't give a fuck
about your leg.

2341
02:21:00,158 --> 02:21:01,364
Huh.

2342
02:21:01,478 --> 02:21:03,879
Now, you just...

2343
02:21:03,998 --> 02:21:06,079
make yourself comfortable.

2344
02:21:06,197 --> 02:21:08,325
Don't worry about my comfort.

2345
02:21:08,437 --> 02:21:12,044
Shit, I can't feel
my ass no more.

2346
02:21:12,157 --> 02:21:14,967
Worry about these owl hoots

2347
02:21:15,077 --> 02:21:20,606
and that bushwhackin'
nut shooter in the basement.

2348
02:21:20,716 --> 02:21:22,878
All right!

2349
02:21:22,996 --> 02:21:27,956
You... fella in the basement!

2350
02:21:28,075 --> 02:21:33,605
You either give up
by the time I count to three...

2351
02:21:33,715 --> 02:21:36,878
or I shoot Domergue in the head.

2352
02:21:37,035 --> 02:21:39,321
One!

2353
02:21:39,434 --> 02:21:41,038
Two!

2354
02:21:41,154 --> 02:21:44,556
No, no, no, no,
don't shoot her in the head!

2355
02:21:44,674 --> 02:21:46,119
I'm coming up.

2356
02:21:46,234 --> 02:21:49,874
Hold on now,
you bushwhackin' sack shooter!

2357
02:21:49,993 --> 02:21:51,518
You just open the door.

2358
02:21:51,673 --> 02:21:53,596
We tell you when to come up.

2359
02:21:58,033 --> 02:22:01,002
Now throw out your pistol.

2360
02:22:01,112 --> 02:22:03,080
Toward the bed.

2361
02:22:05,512 --> 02:22:08,675
Bet he got another.

2362
02:22:08,792 --> 02:22:11,443
Now throw out your other pistol.

2363
02:22:11,552 --> 02:22:13,076
I ain't got another pistol!

2364
02:22:13,191 --> 02:22:15,273
Well, you better shit
another pistol out your ass,

2365
02:22:15,391 --> 02:22:17,041
'cause if you don't
throw one up here

2366
02:22:17,151 --> 02:22:20,234
in the next two seconds,
we gonna kill this bitch.

2367
02:22:23,190 --> 02:22:24,680
See?

2368
02:22:24,830 --> 02:22:26,958
Told you.

2369
02:22:27,070 --> 02:22:31,678
Now, with your hands
where we can see 'em,

2370
02:22:31,790 --> 02:22:36,238
slowly come on up.

2371
02:23:07,946 --> 02:23:10,347
How you doing, dummy?

2372
02:23:10,466 --> 02:23:15,154
Better,
now I see your ugly face.

2373
02:23:21,785 --> 02:23:23,230
How you like that?!

2374
02:23:23,385 --> 02:23:25,149
You bushwhackin' castrator!

2375
02:23:25,265 --> 02:23:27,506
What are you doing?!
He was giving up!

2376
02:23:27,625 --> 02:23:29,991
It took him too long,
so I done it for him.

2377
02:23:33,144 --> 02:23:37,433
Joe Gage, get your ass over
here and shut this trap door.

2378
02:23:57,382 --> 02:23:59,384
I'm sorry, honey.

2379
02:24:07,541 --> 02:24:09,430
May I sit in a chair?

2380
02:24:09,541 --> 02:24:12,226
Yes, you may.

2381
02:24:21,420 --> 02:24:23,900
Keep your hands
flat on that table.

2382
02:24:24,020 --> 02:24:25,987
And don't move 'em.

2383
02:24:26,099 --> 02:24:28,306
Mannix!

2384
02:24:28,419 --> 02:24:31,980
You sure picked the wrong time
to turn into a nigger lover.

2385
02:24:32,099 --> 02:24:33,659
Don't you see,
that nigger and John Ruth

2386
02:24:33,779 --> 02:24:35,668
put you smack dab
in the middle of danger?

2387
02:24:35,779 --> 02:24:37,064
You're about to be murdered

2388
02:24:37,178 --> 02:24:38,384
in some nigger
named Minnie's house,

2389
02:24:38,498 --> 02:24:40,387
and you don't even know why!

2390
02:24:40,538 --> 02:24:44,224
Okay... bitch.

2391
02:24:44,338 --> 02:24:46,545
I'll bite.

2392
02:24:46,658 --> 02:24:47,988
Why?

2393
02:24:48,097 --> 02:24:50,748
I'm working with
all three of them fellas.

2394
02:24:50,857 --> 02:24:52,825
But not 'cause they got
butterflies in their belly

2395
02:24:52,937 --> 02:24:55,702
about me, but because
we're all gang members.

2396
02:24:55,817 --> 02:24:58,104
The Jody Domingre Gang.

2397
02:24:58,217 --> 02:25:01,743
That fella y'all just killed
in the basement

2398
02:25:01,856 --> 02:25:03,346
was Jody Domingre!

2399
02:25:03,456 --> 02:25:05,538
My brother!

2400
02:25:05,656 --> 02:25:10,024
Well, who the hell
is Jody Domingre?

2401
02:25:10,135 --> 02:25:12,263
You want to tell him,
bounty man?

2402
02:25:13,655 --> 02:25:17,546
He was a big bad cat
worth $50,000.

2403
02:25:17,695 --> 02:25:21,699
And every member of his gang
was worth at least ten.

2404
02:25:21,814 --> 02:25:24,738
Which finally explains
why you worth ten.

2405
02:25:24,854 --> 02:25:27,175
And what's gonna happen when
that sun comes out, nigger?

2406
02:25:27,294 --> 02:25:30,025
So is my brother's 15 men
coming straight here for us.

2407
02:25:30,134 --> 02:25:32,022
Tell him, Grouch!

2408
02:25:32,133 --> 02:25:34,454
Jody got 15 men
waiting in Red Rock.

2409
02:25:36,093 --> 02:25:39,415
We couldn't kill John Ruth
and free Daisy here,

2410
02:25:39,533 --> 02:25:44,060
their job was to sack the town,
kill John Ruth

2411
02:25:44,172 --> 02:25:46,743
and free Daisy there.

2412
02:25:46,852 --> 02:25:50,379
Now, with my brother dead,
I'm in charge of this gang.

2413
02:25:50,492 --> 02:25:51,932
- Right, boys?
- That's right, Daisy.

2414
02:25:51,972 --> 02:25:52,894
Oh, yeah.

2415
02:25:53,012 --> 02:25:54,820
And, Chris, I am telling you,

2416
02:25:54,931 --> 02:25:59,255
you ain't done anything yet
that we can't forgive.

2417
02:25:59,371 --> 02:26:01,214
So, let's make a deal.

2418
02:26:01,331 --> 02:26:02,821
No deals, bitch.

2419
02:26:02,931 --> 02:26:05,376
You gonna let that nigger
speak for you, Chris?!

2420
02:26:05,530 --> 02:26:09,216
Hold it, Warren.

2421
02:26:09,370 --> 02:26:12,340
Seeing as how she ain't got
nothing to sell,

2422
02:26:12,450 --> 02:26:16,454
I'm kinda curious
about her sales pitch.

2423
02:26:16,569 --> 02:26:17,775
Humor me.

2424
02:26:18,889 --> 02:26:22,735
All right... bitch.

2425
02:26:31,288 --> 02:26:36,055
What's... your... deal?

2426
02:26:36,168 --> 02:26:38,170
Easy.

2427
02:26:38,287 --> 02:26:42,895
Take your gun,
shoot that nigger dead.

2428
02:26:43,007 --> 02:26:46,853
Then we sit here all nice-like
for the next two days.

2429
02:26:46,967 --> 02:26:50,129
When the snow melts, we go to
Mexico, you go on to Red Rock,

2430
02:26:50,246 --> 02:26:52,248
get that star
pinned on your chest.

2431
02:26:52,406 --> 02:26:55,410
Hey, Pete.
How much can we pay him?

2432
02:26:55,526 --> 02:26:59,736
Well, we could give him Marco.

2433
02:27:01,405 --> 02:27:04,932
Bob's real name
is Marco the Mexican.

2434
02:27:05,085 --> 02:27:07,531
He's Worth $12,000.

2435
02:27:07,645 --> 02:27:09,852
That's Marco the Mexican?

2436
02:27:10,005 --> 02:27:11,813
Precisely, yeah.

2437
02:27:11,964 --> 02:27:13,614
Shit.

2438
02:27:13,724 --> 02:27:17,729
Now that I blowed his face off,
Marco ain't worth a peso.

2439
02:27:19,564 --> 02:27:20,451
Oh! '

2440
02:27:20,564 --> 02:27:22,134
Oh, sh... Oh, sh...

2441
02:27:22,244 --> 02:27:25,053
Well, then, if I die
in the next two days,

2442
02:27:25,163 --> 02:27:27,689
which is more than likely,
you can have me.

2443
02:27:27,803 --> 02:27:30,647
Under the name of
English Pete Hicox,

2444
02:27:30,763 --> 02:27:35,006
I got a federal bounty
of $15,000 on my head.

2445
02:27:37,442 --> 02:27:39,092
It's all yours, Chris.

2446
02:27:39,242 --> 02:27:42,212
You keep talking, Pete,

2447
02:27:42,322 --> 02:27:46,087
you gonna talk yourself
to death.

2448
02:27:46,201 --> 02:27:49,091
Joe Gage, who you be?

2449
02:27:49,201 --> 02:27:50,691
Grouch Douglass.

2450
02:27:52,481 --> 02:27:53,971
You heard of him?

2451
02:27:54,081 --> 02:27:56,401
Yeah, I heard
of Grouch Douglass.

2452
02:27:56,520 --> 02:27:59,967
He worth ten, just like Daisy.

2453
02:28:00,080 --> 02:28:02,162
Well, remind me...

2454
02:28:02,280 --> 02:28:07,445
why we wouldn't just
kill all y'all, cash in.

2455
02:28:07,599 --> 02:28:10,842
Oh, you can kill us all,
but you'll never spend a cent

2456
02:28:10,959 --> 02:28:12,245
of that bounty money,

2457
02:28:12,399 --> 02:28:14,766
and you'll never
leave this mountain alive.

2458
02:28:14,879 --> 02:28:17,200
'Cause when that snow melts,
the rest of Jody's gang,

2459
02:28:17,359 --> 02:28:21,408
all 15 of 'em that are waiting
in Red Rock, are coming here.

2460
02:28:21,518 --> 02:28:24,249
Now, let's say
you shoot us all.

2461
02:28:24,358 --> 02:28:27,965
If you really want all that
Domingre Gang bounty money,

2462
02:28:28,118 --> 02:28:31,121
you still got to get
all our corpses into Red Rock.

2463
02:28:31,237 --> 02:28:33,399
And that ain't gonna be so easy.

2464
02:28:33,517 --> 02:28:35,758
'Cause I... I doubt you can drive
a four-horse team.

2465
02:28:35,917 --> 02:28:38,727
And that wagon out there is
too heavy for a two-horse team.

2466
02:28:38,877 --> 02:28:40,765
So that means
you're gonna have to lead

2467
02:28:40,876 --> 02:28:43,527
a string of horses
into Red Rock.

2468
02:28:43,676 --> 02:28:45,963
And with that deep snow
after a blizzard,

2469
02:28:46,076 --> 02:28:48,363
you ain't gonna be able
to get away with any more than,

2470
02:28:48,476 --> 02:28:50,558
say, one body per horse.

2471
02:28:50,676 --> 02:28:56,478
So that's you leading a string
of four horses into Red Rock.

2472
02:28:56,595 --> 02:29:00,077
And with all them horses
in that snow

2473
02:29:00,195 --> 02:29:03,198
and you all by your lonesome,
you're gonna be a mite poky.

2474
02:29:03,314 --> 02:29:05,635
And you're gonna run smack dab
into the Domingre Gang.

2475
02:29:05,754 --> 02:29:07,677
And again, Grouch,
how many is that?

2476
02:29:07,794 --> 02:29:09,159
15 killers strong.

2477
02:29:09,274 --> 02:29:14,040
And when those 15 killers
come across you

2478
02:29:14,153 --> 02:29:15,996
in possession of
all our dead bodies,

2479
02:29:16,113 --> 02:29:18,480
they ain't just gonna
kill you and that nigger!

2480
02:29:18,593 --> 02:29:20,516
They gonna go back to Red Rock

2481
02:29:20,633 --> 02:29:24,115
and kill every son of a bitch
in that town!

2482
02:29:24,233 --> 02:29:26,121
You really the sheriff
of Red Rock?

2483
02:29:26,232 --> 02:29:28,314
You want to save the town?

2484
02:29:28,432 --> 02:29:30,002
Then shoot that nigger dead!

2485
02:29:31,352 --> 02:29:33,081
Jesus Christ!

2486
02:29:33,192 --> 02:29:34,478
Oh, ho, ho!

2487
02:29:34,592 --> 02:29:36,912
You believe in Jesus now,
huh, bitch?

2488
02:29:37,031 --> 02:29:39,557
Well, good,
'cause you about to meet him.

2489
02:29:41,031 --> 02:29:42,954
Anybody else
want to make a deal? Huh?!

2490
02:29:43,071 --> 02:29:44,721
The deal still stands, Chris.

2491
02:29:46,471 --> 02:29:49,758
You ain't done nothing
we can't forgive.

2492
02:29:49,870 --> 02:29:53,272
It's all still on that nigger.

2493
02:29:53,390 --> 02:29:56,519
You shoot him dead,
take my body,

2494
02:29:56,630 --> 02:29:57,960
sit out in the snow

2495
02:29:58,069 --> 02:29:59,150
with Daisy and Grou...

2496
02:29:59,269 --> 02:30:00,680
You cunt!

2497
02:30:43,985 --> 02:30:46,511
Mannix,

2498
02:30:46,625 --> 02:30:50,152
give me my pistol.

2499
02:30:51,225 --> 02:30:53,670
Give it here!

2500
02:30:58,624 --> 02:31:00,706
Give it here!

2501
02:31:13,903 --> 02:31:18,112
So, you were saying...

2502
02:31:18,222 --> 02:31:22,386
we sit here,
all nice and friendly like,

2503
02:31:22,502 --> 02:31:24,231
for the next two days.

2504
02:31:24,342 --> 02:31:27,311
Then the snow melts,
you leave here,

2505
02:31:27,421 --> 02:31:31,551
meet up with your gang,
and hightail it to Mexico.

2506
02:31:31,701 --> 02:31:33,783
That's the deal, right?

2507
02:31:33,901 --> 02:31:35,141
Yeah.

2508
02:31:35,261 --> 02:31:41,063
And I get Oswaldo and Joe Gage?

2509
02:31:41,180 --> 02:31:43,023
Yeah.

2510
02:31:43,140 --> 02:31:45,347
But Jody's worth $50,000.
What about his body?

2511
02:31:45,460 --> 02:31:50,067
You gonna make a deal

2512
02:31:50,481 --> 02:31:56,002
with this diabolical bitch?

2513
02:31:56,419 --> 02:31:58,219
I ain't saying
I'm gonna make a deal with her.

2514
02:31:58,259 --> 02:31:59,226
We just talking.

2515
02:31:59,339 --> 02:32:02,547
Calm down!

2516
02:32:02,658 --> 02:32:05,423
So what about Jody's body
and the $50,000?

2517
02:32:05,538 --> 02:32:07,063
You're getting greedy, reb.

2518
02:32:07,178 --> 02:32:08,543
No deal.

2519
02:32:08,658 --> 02:32:10,183
We're taking Jody's body
back with us.

2520
02:32:10,298 --> 02:32:11,378
He got children.

2521
02:32:14,457 --> 02:32:19,987
So I kill Warren,
and we all friends?

2522
02:32:21,297 --> 02:32:23,139
Yeah.

2523
02:32:34,135 --> 02:32:36,183
No deal, tramp.

2524
02:32:36,295 --> 02:32:38,616
Chris!

2525
02:32:38,735 --> 02:32:41,420
You're making the biggest
mistake of your life!

2526
02:32:41,535 --> 02:32:43,503
When our boys get here
in a couple of days,

2527
02:32:43,615 --> 02:32:45,218
they're gonna cut your nuts off!

2528
02:32:45,334 --> 02:32:48,861
And there won't be a stick left
in that town unburnt!

2529
02:32:48,974 --> 02:32:53,138
Well, I guess I should be
plumb scared right now, huh?

2530
02:32:54,614 --> 02:32:57,617
If you had any brains,
you would be!

2531
02:32:57,733 --> 02:32:59,497
You see...

2532
02:33:02,733 --> 02:33:04,656
here's the problem, Daisy.

2533
02:33:04,773 --> 02:33:08,618
In order for me to be scared
of your threats,

2534
02:33:08,732 --> 02:33:11,622
I got to believe in
those 15 extra gang members

2535
02:33:11,732 --> 02:33:13,336
waiting it out in Red Rock.

2536
02:33:13,452 --> 02:33:17,900
And boy, oh, boy, I sure don't.

2537
02:33:20,171 --> 02:33:23,254
What I believe is,

2538
02:33:23,371 --> 02:33:29,218
Joe Gage or Grouch Douglass or
whatever the fuck his name was,

2539
02:33:29,330 --> 02:33:32,618
poisoned the coffee.

2540
02:33:32,770 --> 02:33:37,139
And you watched him do it.

2541
02:33:37,250 --> 02:33:41,732
And you watched me pour a cup,
and you didn't say shit!

2542
02:33:42,929 --> 02:33:44,340
And...

2543
02:33:44,489 --> 02:33:49,655
I believe you are
what you've always been,

2544
02:33:49,769 --> 02:33:54,057
a lying bitch
who will do anything

2545
02:33:54,208 --> 02:33:56,210
to cheat the rope
waiting for her in Red Rock,

2546
02:33:56,328 --> 02:33:59,969
including shitting out
15 extra gang members

2547
02:34:00,128 --> 02:34:02,733
whenever you need be.

2548
02:34:02,847 --> 02:34:05,248
Oh, Oh!

2549
02:34:05,367 --> 02:34:07,768
And...

2550
02:34:10,887 --> 02:34:15,255
I believe, when it comes
to what's left

2551
02:34:15,366 --> 02:34:20,691
of the Jody Domingre Gang,
I'm looking at 'em.

2552
02:34:20,806 --> 02:34:23,412
Right here, right now,

2553
02:34:23,566 --> 02:34:26,569
dead on this
motherfucking floor!

2554
02:34:26,685 --> 02:34:28,449
Goddamn right.

2555
02:34:28,565 --> 02:34:32,695
Then you're gonna die
on this mountain, Chris.

2556
02:34:32,805 --> 02:34:36,047
'Cause my brother
leads an army of men.

2557
02:34:36,204 --> 02:34:39,048
Horseshit!

2558
02:34:39,204 --> 02:34:42,048
My daddy led an army.

2559
02:34:42,164 --> 02:34:45,691
He led a renegade army,
fighting for a lost cause!

2560
02:34:45,804 --> 02:34:49,330
My daddy held up to 400 men
together after the war

2561
02:34:49,443 --> 02:34:53,812
with nothing but their respect
in his command!

2562
02:34:53,923 --> 02:34:56,847
Your brother's just an owl hoot
who led a gang of killers!

2563
02:35:00,042 --> 02:35:01,567
I don't feel so good.

2564
02:35:03,242 --> 02:35:04,971
Oh, shit.

2565
02:35:07,882 --> 02:35:09,212
Ha!

2566
02:35:15,521 --> 02:35:17,489
You still alive, white boy?

2567
02:35:18,601 --> 02:35:21,331
Fuck!

2568
02:35:25,720 --> 02:35:27,370
Mannix!

2569
02:35:27,480 --> 02:35:29,244
Oh! Fuck!

2570
02:35:29,360 --> 02:35:31,248
Hey, boy!

2571
02:35:38,479 --> 02:35:39,765
Get up!

2572
02:35:45,558 --> 02:35:47,083
Chris Mannix!

2573
02:35:47,198 --> 02:35:50,441
If your ass ain't nailed
to the floor, wake the fuck up!

2574
02:35:58,677 --> 02:36:00,645
Wake up, white boy!

2575
02:36:22,435 --> 02:36:25,279
I ain't dead yet,
you black bastard.

2576
02:36:36,314 --> 02:36:41,194
Chris Mannix,
I may have misjudged you.

2577
02:36:41,313 --> 02:36:44,283
Now we've come
to the part of the story...

2578
02:36:47,193 --> 02:36:50,116
where I blow
your goddamn head off.

2579
02:36:50,232 --> 02:36:52,473
No! No, no, don't shoot her!

2580
02:36:52,592 --> 02:36:54,993
Why the hell not?

2581
02:36:55,112 --> 02:36:57,001
John Ruth.

2582
02:37:02,431 --> 02:37:04,209
Now...

2583
02:37:04,269 --> 02:37:08,965
John Ruth was one mighty,
mighty bastard.

2584
02:37:13,830 --> 02:37:19,678
But the last thing
that bastard did 'fore he died

2585
02:37:19,790 --> 02:37:21,599
was save your life.

2586
02:37:21,710 --> 02:37:24,918
We gonna die, white boy.

2587
02:37:25,029 --> 02:37:26,758
We ain't got no say in that.

2588
02:37:29,469 --> 02:37:33,234
But there is one thing left
we do have a say in.

2589
02:37:33,348 --> 02:37:37,194
And that's
how we kill this bitch.

2590
02:37:38,708 --> 02:37:41,518
And I say shooting's
too good for her.

2591
02:37:41,628 --> 02:37:47,589
John Ruth could've shot her
anywhere anytime along the way.

2592
02:37:47,707 --> 02:37:52,634
But John Ruth was The Hangman.

2593
02:37:52,747 --> 02:37:54,715
And when The Hangman
catches you,

2594
02:37:54,827 --> 02:37:58,387
you don't die by no bullet.

2595
02:37:58,506 --> 02:38:02,716
When The Hangman catches you,
you hang.

2596
02:38:02,826 --> 02:38:05,955
"You only need to hang
mean bastards... "

2597
02:38:06,066 --> 02:38:07,510
Mm-hmm.

2598
02:38:07,625 --> 02:38:11,186
"But mean bastards,
you need to hang. "

2599
02:38:34,063 --> 02:38:37,909
As my first and final act

2600
02:38:38,023 --> 02:38:41,151
as the sheriff of Red Rock,

2601
02:38:41,302 --> 02:38:44,033
I sentence you, Domergue,

2602
02:38:44,142 --> 02:38:47,430
to hang by the neck until death!

2603
02:39:02,220 --> 02:39:04,063
Hang on, Daisy.

2604
02:39:04,180 --> 02:39:06,262
I want to watch.

2605
02:39:40,737 --> 02:39:43,786
Now, that was a nice dance.

2606
02:39:43,897 --> 02:39:45,501
Oh.

2607
02:39:45,617 --> 02:39:48,745
That sure was pretty.

2608
02:39:53,216 --> 02:39:54,103
Shit!

2609
02:40:41,252 --> 02:40:42,776
Hey.

2610
02:40:44,811 --> 02:40:47,178
Can I see that Lincoln letter?

2611
02:41:29,967 --> 02:41:33,449
"Dear Marquis,

2612
02:41:33,567 --> 02:41:36,730
"I hope this letter finds you

2613
02:41:36,847 --> 02:41:41,170
"in good health and stead.

2614
02:41:41,286 --> 02:41:43,766
"I'm doing fine,

2615
02:41:43,926 --> 02:41:48,852
"although I wish there were
more hours in a day.

2616
02:41:48,965 --> 02:41:52,367
"There's just so much to do.

2617
02:41:52,485 --> 02:41:56,968
"Times are changing
slowly but surely,

2618
02:41:57,085 --> 02:42:02,090
"and it's men like you
that will make a difference.

2619
02:42:02,204 --> 02:42:05,147
"Your military success

2620
02:42:05,203 --> 02:42:08,905
"is a credit not only to you,

2621
02:42:08,940 --> 02:42:11,607
"but your race as well.

2622
02:42:11,723 --> 02:42:17,253
"I'm very proud
every time I hear news of you.

2623
02:42:17,363 --> 02:42:21,492
"We still have a long way to go,

2624
02:42:21,602 --> 02:42:24,598
"but hand in hand,

2625
02:42:24,857 --> 02:42:27,819
"I know we will get there.

2626
02:42:28,578 --> 02:42:33,532
"I just want to let you know
you're in my thoughts.

2627
02:42:33,681 --> 02:42:39,006
"Hopefully, our paths
will cross in the future.

2628
02:42:39,121 --> 02:42:41,591
"Until then,

2629
02:42:41,723 --> 02:42:45,770
"I remain your friend.

2630
02:42:46,240 --> 02:42:49,210
"Ole Mary Todd's calling,

2631
02:42:49,360 --> 02:42:54,968
"so I guess
it must be time for bed.

2632
02:42:55,079 --> 02:43:00,085
Respectfully, Abraham Lincoln. "

2633
02:43:03,999 --> 02:43:06,239
"Ole Mary Todd. "

2634
02:43:06,358 --> 02:43:08,679
That's a nice touch.

2635
02:43:08,838 --> 02:43:11,284
Yeah.

2636
02:43:11,398 --> 02:43:13,366
Thanks.
