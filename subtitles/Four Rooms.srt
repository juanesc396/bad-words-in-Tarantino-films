1
00:00:06,382 --> 00:00:11,678
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

2
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:17,058
And never brought
to mind

3
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:22,063
- Should auld acquaintance...
- We used to have 50 on staff here. Fifty.

4
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,148
I'm the only one left.

5
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,442
All comes down
to one schmuck:

6
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:29,779
Me, the night shift bellhop.

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:35,076
What the hell is that?
A bellhop? Huh? What is he?

8
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,620
Y-You know where
the name comes from?

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,916
Huh?
It's so simple, it's stupid.

10
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,502
Some schmuck rings a bell
and ya hop.

11
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:46,796
Ya hop front and center.

12
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,923
Did you ever meet
any of the old stars, then?

13
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:54,137
What, are you kiddin'? I took Rin Tin
Tin out for a shit, for Christ's sakes.

14
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,973
Ah, hey, you talk
about stars, uh...

15
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,684
Hey, kid,

16
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,686
put this on.

17
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,731
Put it on. Put it on. Go ahead.
Come on, come on, come on.

18
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,483
Let me see. Let me see.

19
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:11,362
You know, and to think that I wore
that stupid thing for 50 years.

20
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:15,408
To think
I did that. Ah, shit, yeah.

21
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,411
Yeah, well...
Well, kid,

22
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,621
I'm gettin'
my ass outta here.

23
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,751
Yep.

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,503
Yep, kid,

25
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,839
gotta go.

26
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:32,425
Listen, kid,

27
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,802
stay clear of...

28
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:39,432
night clerks, kids,
hookers and married arguments.

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,268
Come on, stand up. Come on.
I wanna say good-bye.

30
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:44,270
Now, uh...

31
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,564
Let me see.
You... You wanna get a tip?

32
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:52,195
Hold your hand out.
That's right. Now, uh, smile.

33
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,947
Give me a smile. Give me
a smile. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,074
Now, if the cocksucker
doesn't pay ya,

35
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,244
you say to yourself, uh,
"Fuck you, Jack."

36
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,790
You know what I mean?
You never miss.

37
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,209
Tell you something else:

38
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:09,003
Keep your cock in your pants.

39
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,810
May I help you?

40
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,729
I have a reservation.

41
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,151
In the honeymoon suite.

42
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,583
- Kiva.
- Wait up.

43
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,961
What'd I tell you
about smoking?

44
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,839
- You smoke.
- That's right, I do, and I'm addicted.

45
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,926
So, welcome to this week's edition
of "Who is a Hypocrite?"

46
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,678
- This is my first guest.
- That's enough, Kiva.

47
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,931
- You're not my mother.
- Yes, I am.

48
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,017
Then why are we
sleeping together?

49
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,646
Ahh.

50
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,773
Mmm.

51
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,944
Yes.

52
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,730
Thank you.

53
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,942
Oh, you little stinker

54
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,987
Oh, you sweet
little muffin

55
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,157
Yes, Mama loves
the baby.

56
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,582
Hello.

57
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,001
I'm lookin' for the room
for makin' love.

58
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,837
Oh, right. You must mean
the honeymoon suite.

59
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,591
- Well, it's straight that way. Can't miss it.
- Uh-huh. I know where it is.

60
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:32,928
I just wanted you to know that I know
where I'm goin', so you needn't bother with me.

61
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:36,307
Well, no problem.
Where's your luggage?

62
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,476
I travel light.

63
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,995
Tell me, how long have
the others been here?

64
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,039
About an hour.

65
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,124
One hour.

66
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,565
You're very late, Eva.

67
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:30,486
I'm sorry, Athena. I was attending a
birth. The placenta was late in coming.

68
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:34,323
Which birth is more important
to you, Eva: That of a mortal,

69
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,492
or that of a goddess?

70
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,535
Will there be
anything else, ladies?

71
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,039
Wait.
We do need some things.

72
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:46,168
We need... fresh rosemary
from the kitchen.

73
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,170
Mostly what we need
is from the kitchen.

74
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,257
Hey. Are you listening?

75
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,259
Rosemary.

76
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,636
We need sea salt,
a little bit of sea salt.

77
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,680
Or kosher salt,
if you have no sea salt.

78
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:01,058
A bottle of spring water...
French, not that Italian shit.

79
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,728
- Um, yes, and could I have some French fries?
- Shut up, Kiva.

80
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,940
Some ginger
and some raw meat.

81
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,945
- Liver, if you have it. - I want fries,
you stupid jerks with your dumb fucking ritual.

82
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,114
Shut up, you little shit!

83
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,116
Hey.

84
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,911
- Don't talk to her that way.
- Uh,

85
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:23,664
if there's nothing else...

86
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,964
Thank you.

87
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,157
We're communing here
on New Year's Eve...

88
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,452
to bring to life
the great goddess Diana,

89
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,330
who was turned into stone
in this very room...

90
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,291
40 years ago today.

91
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,845
Diana, O Great Beautiful One,

92
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:22,306
we make
these offerings to you...

93
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,393
so that we may undo the wicked spell
which deprived you...

94
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,687
of the seed of your lover...

95
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,316
of your virginal blood...

96
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,028
of your very life.

97
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,908
We now form the symbolic rock...

98
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,494
with our bodies.

99
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,512
On this night,
in this hour,

100
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,640
we call upon
the ancient power.

101
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,809
O Goddess Bride,

102
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,811
we offer thee...

103
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,731
milk from a mother's
sweet titty.

104
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,321
To reverse this evil
which has been done,

105
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,074
I make this offering...

106
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,326
to the Divine One.

107
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,454
A whore not,

108
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,456
an innocent was,

109
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,959
for whom I seized
a virgin's blood.

110
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,132
Goddess of Light,
Goddess of Lust,

111
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:23,218
to undo this awful spell
is a real must.

112
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,680
To bring you life
and get you high,

113
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,767
I offer the sweat
of five men's thighs.

114
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,189
O Diana,
O Great One,

115
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,357
we live without sun...

116
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,776
until this wicked curse
is undone.

117
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,029
In hope that you appear,

118
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,573
I have collected
a year's worth of tears.

119
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,079
Goddess Diana,
fail you, I will.

120
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:54,333
I was to bring you
fresh sperm from my Bill.

121
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,503
I had him erect,
and his semen would follow,

122
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,505
but alas, I was hot,

123
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,715
so hot that I swallowed.

124
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,765
You stupid witch!

125
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,560
- You swallowed the sperm? You did?
- Why didn't you use your hands?

126
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:17,856
Well, it just goes to show you what an
amazing lack of control you have, Eva.

127
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,068
Didn't your mama teach you not to put
them things in your mouth?

128
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,154
- I understand, though.
- Eva,

129
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:27,741
you got one hour
to find me some sperm,

130
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,452
one hour to show me...

131
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,746
What kind of witch
you can be.

132
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,748
- You hear me?
- Uh-huh.

133
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,252
Ted, the bellhop.

134
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,295
Mr. Bellboy,

135
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,756
come right in.

136
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,976
Okay, mister.

137
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,479
Here is your $50 tip,

138
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:01,066
only you have to do
one more thing.

139
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:03,277
You have to make
our little Eva smile.

140
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,571
We'll leave you alone.

141
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,377
Don't use your mouth.

142
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,441
Oh.

143
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:04,421
Help me out here.
I've got to earn this 50 bucks.

144
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,799
Look, they don't care
if I smile or not.

145
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,885
They just want...

146
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,263
You wouldn't understand.

147
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,224
Try me.

148
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,477
I've been around
a bit, you know.

149
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,564
Well,

150
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,566
the five of us...

151
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:29,363
Athena, Jezebel, Raven,
Elspeth and me... are a coven.

152
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,491
- Like a coven of witches.
- Yes.

153
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,243
- Oh.
- You see,

154
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,372
for 40 years
we've been trying to...

155
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:42,376
reverse an evil spell
that was placed on our goddess Diana.

156
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,461
She was a beautiful virgin,

157
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:48,298
an entertainer by trade
but a great sorceress by design.

158
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,470
It was here in this very room
on her wedding night...

159
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,264
that a jealous rival
placed this curse on Diana.

160
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,226
Her husband was turned
into a pink fish,

161
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,604
while our dear goddess...

162
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:07,234
a stone
in her honeymoon bed.

163
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,655
This was Diana.

164
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,121
- She's the blonde.
- Ah. Right.

165
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,130
Hmm.

166
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,340
Well.

167
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,594
Ooh.

168
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:41,101
Say.

169
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,771
Oh.

170
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,534
Well.

171
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,536
Hate to tell you this,
but, uh,

172
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,747
I kinda doubt
she was a virgin.

173
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:04,458
She had lovers,
but she saved that for marriage.

174
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:08,253
If she doesn't get his goop in ten minutes,
I'm gonna go in there and get it myself.

175
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:11,548
That'd be a first for you.

176
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:19,014
You mean, you were
supposed to bring, uh...

177
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,935
And you...

178
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,813
Eewhh.

179
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,316
And now...

180
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,610
you're my last chance.

181
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,655
W-Whoa.

182
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,909
Uh-uh.

183
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,952
No way.

184
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,996
Nope.

185
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,041
Besides,

186
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,919
it's against hotel policy.

187
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,046
I was warned.

188
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,424
"No sex with the clientele."

189
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,398
Oh.

190
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,947
See, what I really
wanna do is be a midwife.

191
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,949
I've attended
four births already.

192
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,409
I can prevent vaginal tears
and everything.

193
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,371
Really? That's good.

194
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,916
Yes. A fella doesn't like
too many surprises down there.

195
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,878
I joined the coven to obtain greater
understanding of my feminine powers.

196
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,047
Oh, really?

197
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:37,133
- Seems to be working.
- You really think so?

198
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,594
Oh. Yeah.

199
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,724
Oh, God.

200
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:47,185
Betty's gonna kill me.

201
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,105
Who's Betty?

202
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,774
- The boss.
- Oh, good.

203
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,860
Oh, God.

204
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,845
My number in Topanga.

205
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,847
Call me?

206
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,474
Sure, baby. I'll call you.

207
00:20:56,547 --> 00:21:00,008
- What's that used for?
- This is, um... It's a birch branch.

208
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,510
It symbolizes eternal life.

209
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,223
- I'm a woman now.
- Marvelous.

210
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:10,352
I use this bark for a tea
which assists in astral travel.

211
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,896
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I wanna be a witch.

212
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,231
- Great. - Okay.
- You are.

213
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,651
We did it right there
in the big cauldron.

214
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:22,530
Great. Great.

215
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,616
Athena.

216
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,581
Goddess Diana,
I offer to you...

217
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,376
the jism of the one
I wooed for you,

218
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:37,545
so you may live
and know such bliss...

219
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,298
as getting laid
by a guy like this.

220
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,184
So mote it be.

221
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:55,522
Three times three times three.

222
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,693
Ah.

223
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,942
Just a minute! Yeah!

224
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:44,237
- Room service.
- Wait. W-W-What room is this?

225
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:46,865
This is the front desk, sir.

226
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,743
- W-What room we in?
- I don't know, man. I just got here.

227
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,912
404. It's room 404,
I think.

228
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,625
- Look, I thought we were on the fifth floor.
- All right! 409. Yeah.

229
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,669
Hmm, sir?

230
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,130
Hey, is he
talkin' to me?

231
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,467
- Look, 404. We're in room 404.
- Yeah.

232
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:08,303
- What do you need, sir?
- What do we need? What do we need?

233
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,472
- Ice. Ice.
- Ice.

234
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,183
- Ice?
- Ice. Yeah, ice!

235
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,311
Right, sir.
404, sir. Ice, sir.

236
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:18,730
I'll be with you momentarily.

237
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:22,901
Ooh. Disco.

238
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,388
Hello.

239
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,896
Anybody there?

240
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:03,483
What'd you expect, Theodore,

241
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,652
a fuckin' floor show?

242
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,613
Aah!

243
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:15,036
Um,

244
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,163
is this room 404?

245
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,670
Obviously I've come
at a very bad time.

246
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:28,007
Let's not beleaguer the fact
that you have no sense of timing.

247
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:32,929
The fact is, you're here,

248
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,973
and I couldn't think
of a better time for you...

249
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:38,351
to introduce me to your beau
than on New Year's Eve.

250
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:42,188
There's obviously been
a big mistake.

251
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,985
My name is Theodore. Yes.

252
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:50,113
I'm the bellhop.

253
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,977
Yoo-hoo. Lover boy.

254
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:23,396
Let's cut to the chase,
okay?

255
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:32,322
Is this about another man
or something?

256
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:36,242
Let's get our ABC's
right here, Theodore.

257
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:40,038
Theodore, right?

258
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,040
Ted's better.

259
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:45,084
Ted. Okay.

260
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:50,298
Are you saying my wife
cheats on me?

261
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,722
Come here.

262
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,809
Theodore.

263
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:06,397
This is about as intimate
a situation as you can get:

264
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,524
You,

265
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:12,403
me, Angela here.

266
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,697
Pretty cozy, isn't it?

267
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,699
Now,

268
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,701
I demand an apology.

269
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,996
Oh, shit!

270
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,334
What?

271
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:33,549
- Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.
- We ain't got no needles here, kid,

272
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:37,136
just a big fuckin' gun.

273
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,264
- How's that grab ya?
- Shh.

274
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:42,350
Ciao, bambino.

275
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,064
Now...

276
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,609
where was I?

277
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,028
Ah. Ah, yeah.

278
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,741
I remember.

279
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,246
Now...

280
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,331
this...

281
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,252
Gimme that. Gimme that.

282
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,171
No. Bad idea.
Say the following.

283
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,340
Come here. Come here.

284
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,761
"I..."

285
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:21,347
- "I,
- I,

286
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,474
- "Theodore,
- Theodore,

287
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:25,601
- must humbly..."
- humbleh...

288
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:28,438
- Humbly! Humbly!
- Humbleh. Humbly.

289
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:32,567
- "And sincerely...
- And sincerely...

290
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:36,195
- apologize..."
- polgize...

291
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,657
- Apologize!
- Polgi...

292
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,701
Apologize.
Apologize. Apologize.

293
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,786
- "For saying...
- Saying...

294
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,748
saying that I fucked
another man."

295
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,670
- That...
- Saying that I fucked another man!

296
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,797
Saying that I fucked
another man.

297
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,883
Great.

298
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,802
Satisfied?

299
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:03,723
Uh, do you accept
the fuckin' apology?

300
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,019
Oh.

301
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:11,230
You always have to have
the last word, Angela.

302
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,817
Aw, it's just
one way with you.

303
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,114
May I...

304
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:23,368
Shit, yeah.
Come on, come on. Spit it out.

305
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:26,871
I don't mean to
upset you further, sir,

306
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,208
but I do think she was
trying to say yes.

307
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:43,763
Are you... condescending
to me, Theodore?

308
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:48,059
Absolutely not, sir.

309
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:52,230
Don't you think I noticed
there's a gag in the woman's mouth?

310
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:56,317
You know why I know that?

311
00:28:56,527 --> 00:29:01,656
- How, sir?
- Because I put that gag in her mouth!

312
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:07,203
Don't move
a nose hair.

313
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:14,043
Whoa!

314
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:19,173
Don't be a stranger, Teddy!
Take off your jacket and relax!

315
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,721
What?

316
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:33,062
We don't have time to play charades
here, you asshole. Untie me.

317
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,398
- Listen!
- Jesus, honey!

318
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,400
- I would appreciate it...
- Where'd you put the Percodan?

319
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,402
If you would tell
that nut case in there...

320
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,530
he's making a big
fucking mistake.

321
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,116
Look, whether
you like it or not,

322
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:49,036
you are in the middle of a situation here
you cannot just wish your way out of.

323
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:51,581
But I've never met
you people before!

324
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,875
You're complete strangers!

325
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,878
Everybody starts out as strangers.
It's where we end up that counts.

326
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,881
- You being a good boy, Theodore?
- Quick. He's coming back.

327
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,258
Put the gag back in my mouth.
We play this game all the time.

328
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:04,510
Play by the rules and you
won't get hurt. Quick.

329
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:07,472
Come on, put the gag back in my mouth.
Quick! Quick! Quick.

330
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:12,185
- Remember, don't make him mad.
- I hope you're being a good boy, Teddy.

331
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,729
- Oh! Teddy!
- Whoops!

332
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,106
Oh!

333
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:20,485
I was just
beginning to think...

334
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:22,987
I could trust you, Theodore.

335
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:25,156
Just trying to help her
breathe a little.

336
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,534
Well, don't let me
stop you, Teddy.

337
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:32,622
You don't mind my calling
you Teddy, do you?

338
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,665
No, it's fine.

339
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,918
You know, once upon a time...

340
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,712
I had a little bunny rabbit.

341
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,759
His name was Teddy. He looked real cute
nibblin' on Angela's ear.

342
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:48,221
But you're no bunny rabbit,
and picturing you do it...

343
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:52,141
really fuckin' razzes me.

344
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,602
But don't let me stop you.

345
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,729
Nibble, Teddy.

346
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:59,607
If this is some kind of...

347
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,609
weird voodoo thing...

348
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:05,321
and you want me to have
sex with your wife,

349
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:08,074
there's absolutely no way.

350
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:10,910
Start nibblin', motherfucker!

351
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,412
Now! Now!

352
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:15,414
Oh.

353
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:19,252
That's it.
Hop like a bunny.

354
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,301
Don't be shy.

355
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:32,848
Good boy.

356
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:44,569
What's the problem,
Sparky?

357
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:47,446
No whiz left in the cheese?

358
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:51,701
Look, I'm not playing
this game anymore.

359
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,579
It'll be over soon.

360
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:57,415
Then you can go home
to Mommy,

361
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,834
- Theodore.
- Ted!

362
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,755
The name's Ted.

363
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:08,551
Yes, my mother did me the disservice
of naming me Theodore,

364
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:11,762
and I haven't a clue as to how you know that,
because everybody who knows that...

365
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:14,473
is thousands
of fucking miles away.

366
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,809
Have you any idea,

367
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:20,396
the faintest idea,

368
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:25,484
what it's like to arrive at school and find
yourself surrounded by the maladjusted?

369
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,697
And there you stand.

370
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:34,076
Little Lord Fauntleroy.

371
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:37,913
Ever worn a bonnet?
Give it a try sometime.

372
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,250
So shoot me now,

373
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,629
because no one is ever...

374
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:48,758
going to call me...
Theodore again,

375
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,968
let alone...

376
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,471
Theo...

377
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,514
the Thumper.

378
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,233
Wow.

379
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:16,744
Sigfried.

380
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,832
What?

381
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,835
That's my name.

382
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:28,005
- Sigfried.
- Sigfried?

383
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:32,635
Nice to meet ya.

384
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:35,054
νery impressive,

385
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,098
Ted.

386
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:40,601
- Thank you.
- It's a deal, kid.

387
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:44,397
Ted it will be.

388
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:47,608
Whew.

389
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,580
Hmm?

390
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:07,086
My heart! Aah!

391
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:13,592
My... nitro pills
in the bathroom! Quick!

392
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,353
Hurry!

393
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:29,316
Next to the condoms!
They may be in my medicine bag!

394
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,236
This is it!

395
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:36,282
Oh, this is the big one,
Angie!

396
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,951
Dear God!

397
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,038
Someone turn on
the lights!

398
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:48,252
- Nitro. Nitro. Nitro.
- Oh, baby, I got the chills!

399
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:52,673
I can't feel my leg!
It's fucked up!

400
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:00,723
Nitro! Where's the fuckin'
white lightning?

401
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,601
Can't live without my...

402
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,686
Ooh!

403
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,358
Help me!

404
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:16,238
- No time to take a leak! I'm dyin', here!
- Help! Help!

405
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:28,584
Help me!

406
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,890
Good evening.

407
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:48,103
Ah.

408
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,996
I'm stuck
in a situation here...

409
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,291
which I couldn't possibly
begin to explain.

410
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,711
What I was wondering:
Do you think you could, uh,

411
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,548
call the police, sir?

412
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:18,968
Are you all right,
sir? Sir?

413
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,095
Ice.

414
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,956
Yoo-hoo. Sigfried.

415
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:56,755
Oh, my God! Sigfried!

416
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,883
Angela!

417
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:08,475
Ohh! Ohh!

418
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,396
Where is the fucking nitro?

419
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,481
- Couldn't find it.
- What do you mean, you couldn't find it?

420
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:16,483
Untie me! I'll find it!

421
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:19,236
It's your fault he's so upset!
Now he's dying!

422
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,780
I'll get some help!

423
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,782
Aah!

424
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:27,411
I tie a pretty good knot,
don't I, Ted?

425
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:30,456
Sigfried!

426
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:34,835
Thank God, you're okay!

427
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,505
You bastard.

428
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,801
Aw, honey.

429
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:48,390
Don't get mad. It was just a little test,
and I'm glad that I did it, because now I know...

430
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:50,476
you love me forever,

431
00:37:50,644 --> 00:37:52,895
truly...

432
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,897
and deeply.

433
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,524
If the simple fact that I didn't want
your bloated, dead body...

434
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:02,363
lying out on the floor is love, then no wonder
we find ourselves as we are at this very moment.

435
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:07,743
Oh, no. I heard genuine care in your
voice. Can't be denied, can it, Ted?

436
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:10,245
I think you're right,

437
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,958
and if you just keep this kind
of open dialogue going,

438
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,835
I think you'll go a long way
to resolving this misunderstanding.

439
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:20,464
You'd be surprised what happens
if people just listen...

440
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:23,926
without succumbing
to all that pain and anger.

441
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:28,263
You heard shit, monkey boy. Easy for you
to say after you fuck another man's wife.

442
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:31,141
You should at least have
the guts to stand behind...

443
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:33,435
your convictions.

444
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:37,189
She's lying, Sigfried.
I swear to God.

445
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:40,359
You know, when I think
of all the times you were inside me...

446
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,945
promising me a better life,
it makes me wanna puke.

447
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,575
Why are you doing this to me?

448
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:53,831
What have I ever done
to you people?

449
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,333
What didn't you do,
stick man?

450
00:38:56,543 --> 00:39:00,796
Unfortunately, you don't have the balls
to back up the actions of your huge cock.

451
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:03,882
No, no, no.

452
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:07,386
He's got a huge cock?

453
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:10,556
Oh, no, no, no, no.

454
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,475
- Show it to me.
- It's not that big.

455
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:18,147
Put it this way: God made up for what
he did to Gumby with Teddy here.

456
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,482
Show it to me!

457
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:24,194
Show him your cock, Theodore.

458
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,531
Please stop talking about his cock!

459
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:31,326
Well, it's hard to stop talking
about something that's so huge.

460
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:35,039
I mean, I could go
on and on about his cock,

461
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:37,041
his bone,

462
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,168
- his knob,
- Shh.

463
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,795
His bishop,

464
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:46,925
wang, thang, rod, hot rod,
humpmobile,

465
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,927
Oscar, dong,
dagger, banana,

466
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:51,221
Cucumber, salami,

467
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:54,516
sausage, kielbasa,
schlong,

468
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,853
dink, tool, Big Ben, Mr. Happy, peter,

469
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:01,190
Pecker, pee-pee, wee-wee, wiener,
pisser, pistol, joint, hose, horn,

470
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,192
middle leg, third leg,
meat,

471
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,236
Stick, joystick, dipstick,

472
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:08,447
one-eyed wonder, Junior, little head,

473
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,241
Little guy, Rumple Foreskin,
Tootsie Roll,

474
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:13,368
love muscle, skin flute,

475
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:16,872
Roto-Rooter, snake...

476
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,832
Please don't go!

477
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:23,420
Hammer, rammer, Spammer,

478
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:26,465
bazooka, rubber, chubby,
sticky, stubby.

479
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,260
Hey, do you know where
room 404 is, man,

480
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,721
'cause I was up
at this party, and...

481
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:36,600
I have absolutely no idea!

482
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,353
Oh.

483
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:45,275
Schmeck, schmuck,
schvantz, ying-yang, yang...

484
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,820
- Whoa! I'm Theodore.
- What?

485
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,114
Well,
you're right on time, Theodore.

486
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,157
Let's not beleaguer the fact...

487
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,409
that you have
no sense of timing.

488
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:57,037
The fact is...

489
00:40:57,247 --> 00:41:00,541
You're here.

490
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,823
Front desk.

491
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:36,535
Bottle of champagne.
Fast.

492
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:51,717
Stand still.

493
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,803
I said stand still.
You're gonna ruin your suit.

494
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,139
Come here. Come here.

495
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,516
Gimme that.

496
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:01,727
Let me see.

497
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:07,900
There. There, you see?
You see?

498
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:12,487
Huh? You look good
with your hair back like this.

499
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,324
Like me. Like me.

500
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,702
Not down and to the side,
all stupid...

501
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:20,829
like your mother
likes to comb it.

502
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,874
No. No.

503
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,460
- Like this.
- Ow.

504
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,482
Gimme this.

505
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,904
Impossible.

506
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:57,282
You've got your mother's hair.
You can't do anything with it.

507
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:01,703
There. Go. Go.

508
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,334
How did you get your hair
in such a tangled mess, huh?

509
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,547
There. Go. Finished.

510
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,679
Are we gonna
have fun tonight?

511
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:26,645
I didn't think so.

512
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,866
Hey.

513
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:43,287
What about leaving
the kids here?

514
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:45,706
- Hmm?
- Here in the room, all by themselves?

515
00:43:45,915 --> 00:43:48,500
No, with the television.

516
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,627
Hmm?

517
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,595
You wanna have fun tonight,
don't you?

518
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:03,724
Yes.

519
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:05,767
Give it to me.
Give it to me.

520
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,894
Give it to me.

521
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:22,034
Hey.

522
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,619
You kids are gonna
stay here watching TV.

523
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:29,916
I want you to be in bed
and asleep before 12:00.

524
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:34,004
- Twelve.
- Your mother and I will be back later on,

525
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,089
maybe.

526
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:40,802
Don't misbehave.

527
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:02,324
Why did we have to get all dressed up
if we're not going with them?

528
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,868
I don't know.

529
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,753
- What are you doing?
- I'm escaping.

530
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:17,047
It stinks in here
anyway.

531
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,132
What did I say?

532
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:26,556
Behave.

533
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,809
Yes, Papa.

534
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:31,186
The champagne
you ordered, sir.

535
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,815
Too late.
Leave it on ice.

536
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:36,817
But I want some now.

537
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:38,902
There'll be plenty for you
at the party, baby.

538
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:42,114
You can bomb yourself
all you want at the party.

539
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:45,367
Put it down. Put it down.

540
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,333
All right.

541
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:57,796
- You want 500 bucks?
- Sure.

542
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,466
- How about three?
- Three hundred dollars?

543
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:03,468
- Yeah.
- Three's fine.

544
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:07,931
Good. My children are staying
here tonight watching TV.

545
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:11,935
I want you to check up
on them every 30 minutes.

546
00:46:12,145 --> 00:46:14,563
- Check up on them?
- Yeah, make sure they're all right.

547
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,441
Make sure they're fed. Make sure
they go to bed. You know, these things.

548
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:20,277
Sir, I can send out
for a baby-sitting service.

549
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,530
No. I don't trust baby-sitters.

550
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,866
My children are safer alone...

551
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:28,118
than with some fucked-up
pedophile baby-sitter...

552
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,245
I don't know from
the man in the fucking moon.

553
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:34,583
What about him? What makes you think
you can trust him?

554
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:39,045
Tell me that's not
a face you can trust.

555
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:41,882
I'd love to help you
with your problem, sir,

556
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:45,385
but unfortunately
I'm here alone tonight.

557
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:48,263
Hmm.

558
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:55,187
One hundred, two hundred,
three hundred.

559
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:57,564
Here you are.

560
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,484
- I thought you said 500.
- No, I said 300.

561
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:03,320
No, sir. I distinctly
heard you say 500.

562
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:06,156
- Are you calling me a liar?
- No, sir.

563
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,867
What I'm saying is that you accidentally
forgot that the first thing you said...

564
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:12,871
But what I last said was 300,
and what you say last is what counts.

565
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:17,584
- Well, then, if you say 500 one last time,
we have a deal. - You fucking with me, pendejo?

566
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:21,338
No, sir, but I'm by myself,

567
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:24,049
and looking after your kids
is a pain in the ass I don't need.

568
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,218
Are you calling my kids
a pain in the ass?

569
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:29,554
Why, no, sir, not the kids.

570
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:33,016
It's the situation
that is a pain in the ass.

571
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:36,770
No, you were right the first time.
They're a pain in the ass.

572
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,356
All right. You win, tough guy.
Five hundred.

573
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,067
You kids
are getting expensive.

574
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,528
What's your name?

575
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:47,072
Ted.

576
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,407
If you need anything,
just dial zero and ask for Ted.

577
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:54,538
- And make sure they're in bed before midnight.
- Before midnight?

578
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:57,123
Then should I wake them up
for the countdown to the New Year?

579
00:47:57,333 --> 00:48:00,335
No.

580
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:03,129
If something happens
to my children...

581
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,513
I wouldn't want to be you.

582
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:16,142
Don't misbehave.

583
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:21,523
Let's get out of here.

584
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:52,095
Okay.

585
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:54,556
These are the rules.

586
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:58,393
Don't break the rules
and I won't break your necks.

587
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:02,939
I always wanted to say that.

588
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:05,567
Someone said that to me
when I was a kid.

589
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,738
Only they weren't joking.

590
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:13,325
The rules are simple:

591
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:16,286
Don't do anything you wouldn't do
if your parents were here.

592
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:19,497
If there's an emergency, call me on the
phone like your dad said. Thank you.

593
00:49:19,707 --> 00:49:25,337
That's not what he said.
He said to call you if we need anything.

594
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:28,673
Well, I have a lot of work to do,
and I can't have you calling me...

595
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:30,675
every time you want
a glass of water, so please,

596
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:33,053
try and limit your calls
to emergencies only.

597
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:36,181
- Thank you.
- We paid you $500.

598
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:40,185
We'll call you
if we need anything.

599
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,437
You don't wanna
get my dad mad.

600
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:49,027
Oh. Well, try and call
only when necessary.

601
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,529
Watch TV, and if you're good,

602
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:53,823
I'll bring you up
some milk and cookies.

603
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:57,786
Bye, now.

604
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,184
Your feet stink.

605
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:25,605
They don't stink.

606
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,821
Check it out! T and A!

607
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,282
Change it. You're not
supposed to watch this.

608
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:39,744
- We're supposed to watch TV.
- Not this kind of TV.

609
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:41,871
Change it.

610
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,750
Leave me alone. Ouch.

611
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:47,877
Ouch.

612
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:02,767
Front desk.

613
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:05,895
- Ted?
- What did I tell you?

614
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:09,315
Don't bother me and you'll get milk and cookies.
Now, do you want them or do you not?

615
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:12,444
I want you to turn off
the nudie station in our room.

616
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:15,613
I cannot turn on an adult station
without the express permission of your parents.

617
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:18,992
No, not turn it on.
Turn it off.

618
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,995
- It's already on.
- Whoa.

619
00:51:22,163 --> 00:51:24,330
That's not what the machine tells me.

620
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:27,375
Well, stop listening
to the machine and listen to me.

621
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:31,463
There's naked ladies dancing on my TV,
and I want 'em off.

622
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:35,008
Like I said, I'll be up later
to put you both to sleep.

623
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:37,469
Bye.

624
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:40,388
Change the channel now!

625
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,896
Man, you're the one
with the stinking feet.

626
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:58,823
They don't stink.

627
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:01,868
- Yeah, they do.
- No, they don't.

628
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:04,746
Here, smell for yourself.

629
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:33,066
Go ahead.

630
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:54,754
Get a bottle opener.

631
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:11,771
Don't shake it.

632
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:17,902
- Front desk.
- Ted? Hi, it's me, Sarah.

633
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:23,074
Who died? No one?
Good. Then don't call me.

634
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:26,870
I just thought I'd tell you that your
cleaning ladies are doing a bum job.

635
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:31,249
There's all kinds of leftover stuff
here: Needles and things.

636
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,251
We're not supposed
to have needles, are we?

637
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,962
I mean, they don't come
with the room, do they?

638
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,464
Send someone up here
to clean this place up right.

639
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,051
I told you not to shake it!

640
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:46,431
I gotta go. My dumb brother just exploded
the champagne all over the room.

641
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:49,851
Oh, and bring us up
a couple of toothbrushes.

642
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,436
There's a card in the bathroom that says

643
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:54,230
you'll bring us free toothbrushes
if we ask for them.

644
00:53:57,151 --> 00:53:59,944
I'm calling a room.
Give me three numbers.

645
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:04,032
Four... zero... nine.

646
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,121
- Hello?
- What?

647
00:54:10,331 --> 00:54:12,790
Hi. You don't know me,
and I don't know you either,

648
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,626
but do you have
any needles?

649
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:18,421
We have needles here, and I was wondering
if they come with the room or not.

650
00:54:18,631 --> 00:54:20,798
We ain't got
no needles here, kid.

651
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:23,635
- No?
- Just a big fuckin' gun.

652
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:25,803
Just checking.

653
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:23,236
This is the bull's-eye.
It's worth 100 points.

654
00:55:23,404 --> 00:55:26,322
This is worth ten points.
This is worth 20 points.

655
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:31,411
This is worth... Hey, wait 'til
I get out of the way!

656
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,833
This is how
an expert throws it.

657
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:45,008
Hello, kiddie-winkies.
I brought your milk and cookies.

658
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:48,219
You're going to have
to eat them now, because...

659
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:50,847
you're going to sleep.

660
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,849
We have
to go to sleep now?

661
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:55,727
Your parents said to put
you to bed before midnight.

662
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:58,062
Well...
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

663
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:02,525
Maybe this way
you'll leave me alone.

664
00:56:02,735 --> 00:56:04,694
Those aren't
milk and cookies.

665
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,821
Well, we ran out
of cookies,

666
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:09,907
so I brought you
milk and saltines.

667
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:13,036
Now, don't complain. Hurry up and eat.
You're going to bed.

668
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:15,204
They're old.

669
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:19,792
Dip them in the milk.
The milk will make them soft.

670
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:29,427
No crackers?

671
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:33,056
Sleepy time. Now, I don't
want you wandering around,

672
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:35,183
so if you need
the rest room...

673
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,468
What about our pajamas?

674
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,929
You wanna look nice in case
there's an earthquake, don't you?

675
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:15,932
- Yeah.
- Well, then, stay in those clothes.

676
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,768
This is some
Mentholatum ointment.

677
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:22,772
Now, under the covers and close
your eyes, and I'll tell you a story.

678
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:25,316
Your dad says he hates baby-sitters,
doesn't trust 'em.

679
00:57:25,526 --> 00:57:27,652
Well, can't say
I blame him, really.

680
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:30,154
You know what my baby-sitter
did to me when I was a kid?

681
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,199
I used to hate
going to sleep.

682
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:36,119
You know, when it's late,
you wanna get up, run around, go crazy.

683
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:38,955
Well, what my baby-sitter
used to do to me...

684
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:41,999
to make sure I'd stay in bed,
not be tempted to get up,

685
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:45,253
was she'd take some of
this vapor rub ointment...

686
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,175
And she'd dab a little
on each eyelid...

687
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:54,846
just to make sure
I'd stay put.

688
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:58,099
There.
Now you have some too.

689
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:02,186
Don't open your eyes
or it'll burn, burn, burn.

690
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:04,188
- What about in the morning?
- Well, if you keep...

691
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:08,693
your eyes shut tight all night, it'll wear off
by morning, but don't open them before then.

692
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,736
Did you ever
open your eyes?

693
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:14,198
Yes, I did,
and look at me now.

694
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:17,660
- We can't.
- Exactly. Good.

695
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,706
You'll do fine.

696
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:25,042
Sleep tight all night...

697
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:28,296
and I won't tell your parents
about the champagne.

698
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,426
Good night.

699
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:27,730
Are you watching TV?

700
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:33,027
Yep. If you wanna watch,
you better go wash your face.

701
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,245
- Unh!
- Be careful.

702
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:46,040
Gimme that!

703
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:06,143
Ah.

704
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:08,980
Hey, what are you doing?

705
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:30,001
Shut up.

706
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,795
You! Shut up!
Shut up!

707
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:40,553
- Ted! - What do you want now,
for Christ sakes? Who died?

708
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:42,680
I don't know,
but she's in my bed.

709
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:45,683
- What?
- There's a dead body in my bed.

710
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:48,019
Nonsense! That's just
your brother sound asleep!

711
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:52,356
No! There's a woman's dead body
inside the bed in the mattress.

712
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:54,900
- You saw the body?
- Yes!

713
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:58,571
Impossible! You've got
the ointment on your eyes.

714
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:02,450
Ya can't see shit!
Now go to sleep!

715
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:08,080
- Go to sleep!
- I washed it off.

716
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:12,168
- The Mentholatum?
- Yeah. Didn't you ever think to do that?

717
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:16,005
Get your ass up here
and call the police,

718
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:19,842
because there's a dead body in my bed,
and it smells like shit, and it looks even worse.

719
01:01:20,052 --> 01:01:22,720
If you don't help us, my dad is going to
lay you down right next to her,

720
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:25,306
I swear to fucking God!

721
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,600
I am coming up there
right this minute!

722
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:31,437
If there is no dead body in that room
by the time I get up there, I'm gonna make one!

723
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:33,606
You...

724
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,233
Little bitch.

725
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,821
Ah, shit!

726
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:05,763
Cover it up.
Cover it up.

727
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:12,895
Thank you.

728
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:27,451
Jesus Christ! What the fuck
is going on here?

729
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:29,829
Your parents are
on their way up here.

730
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:33,624
And I am not taking responsibility
for this mess!

731
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:37,503
- Check under the mattress.
- For what?

732
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:41,048
- For the body. Can't you smell it?
- It's your feet.

733
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:52,768
Fucking Christ!
What the fuck is that?

734
01:02:57,691 --> 01:03:00,109
Police! It's an emergency!

735
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:10,327
Police! Get someone over here
right fucking now.

736
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:14,206
- There's a dead whore stuffed in the mattress!
- Don't call her that.

737
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:17,710
Shut up!
I'm dead fucking serious.

738
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:22,256
- There's a dead fucking whore stuffed...
- Stop calling her that!

739
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:25,259
In the fucking bed!

740
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:28,804
Fuck!

741
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:52,995
If your pad is a wax museum

742
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,752
The young and exotic

743
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:01,921
Following a millionaire

744
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:06,425
A glass and a shaker

745
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:09,386
Our host is
a real scene maker

746
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:27,196
The millionaire's holiday

747
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:33,994
Did they misbehave?

748
01:05:00,772 --> 01:05:04,692
Emergency?

749
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:09,113
Just...

750
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,625
Happy New Year.

751
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:25,754
- Let me speak to Betty.
- Uh, party's over. She probably went home.

752
01:05:25,964 --> 01:05:30,801
- She lives there!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know her.

753
01:05:31,011 --> 01:05:33,679
Well, then get her on the phone.
Tell her it's an emergency.

754
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,682
Who... Who should
I say is calling?

755
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,310
You tell her it's Teddy
from work on the phone.

756
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:42,479
I got some major
fucking emergency.

757
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:45,399
Hi, Ted.
I'm Margaret.

758
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:48,569
You sound down. Has this not been
the happiest of New Years?

759
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:52,615
No, Margaret. This hasn't been
my happiest New Year.

760
01:05:52,824 --> 01:05:55,618
This one's starting off
pretty fucking badly.

761
01:05:55,827 --> 01:05:58,829
- Aw, how come?
- Well, Betty...

762
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,833
leaves me here all by myself,
and first thing right off the bat,

763
01:06:03,043 --> 01:06:04,835
I'm fucked
by a coven of witches.

764
01:06:05,045 --> 01:06:07,796
You were fucked
by an oven full of witches?

765
01:06:08,048 --> 01:06:12,468
A coven of witches!
Not an oven!

766
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:14,928
Well, one witch
in particular.

767
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:19,850
Was she an old hag with a mole on
her face with hair growing out of it?

768
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,685
No, no, she was
very beautiful.

769
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:27,316
Ted? What's the problem?

770
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:32,363
Well, admittedly, that was
the best part of the evening.

771
01:06:32,572 --> 01:06:35,407
It was pretty
bloody good actually.

772
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:39,161
But it's still a pretty unnerving way
to start off the night.

773
01:06:39,371 --> 01:06:41,997
Sounds like a pretty great way
to start off the night to me.

774
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:45,542
- Why don't we just skip over the witches?
- Skipping the witches.

775
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:49,171
Right. Later,
in another room,

776
01:06:49,381 --> 01:06:53,509
some crazy fucking maniac
sticks a gun in my face...

777
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:56,595
and forces me to play out
some psychosexual drama with his wife.

778
01:06:56,763 --> 01:06:58,847
He made you have
psycho sex with his wife?

779
01:06:59,057 --> 01:07:01,684
No, he didn't make me fuck his wife.
He thought I fucked his wife.

780
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:05,020
- He held me at gunpoint with a loaded gun!
- What kind of gun was it?

781
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,356
I don't know.
I'm not a gun guy. It was big.

782
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:11,568
- Was it like Dirty Harry's gun?
- Yeah, sort of like that, yeah.

783
01:07:11,778 --> 01:07:14,488
Did it have a real long barrel
or a short barrel?

784
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:17,157
What difference
does it make?

785
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:21,745
Well, for one thing, it's a difference
between a.44 Magnum and a Magnum.357.

786
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:26,583
Who the fuck cares whether it was a
.44 or a.392? It was a big fucking gun!

787
01:07:26,793 --> 01:07:29,628
It was loaded! And it was pointed
right at my fucking head!

788
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:34,299
- You wanna skip this part too? - I want you
to get Betty on the phone right fucking now.

789
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:39,054
Hold on.
Anybody live here named...

790
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:41,265
What's her name again?

791
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:45,310
- Betty.
- Betty!

792
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:47,980
Whatcha
screaming about?

793
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:50,607
- You're Betty?
- Yeah, I'm Betty. It's my fucking place.

794
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:54,862
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm Margaret. And this is Ted.

795
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:02,327
- You guys, wanna go to breakfast?
- No.

796
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:05,122
- Let's go to Denny's.
- Later.

797
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:10,252
- Okay, Ted, what's the problem?
- Hello, Betty.

798
01:08:10,462 --> 01:08:13,589
"What's the problem?"
I haven't got a problem.

799
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:19,428
- I've got fucking problems.
Plural. Wanna hear? - Sure.

800
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:23,140
Well, most recently,
there's room 309.

801
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:27,728
There's this scary Mexican gangster
dude pokin' his finger in my chest.

802
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:31,023
There's his hooligan kids
snapping their fingers at me.

803
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:35,694
There's a putrid, rotting corpse of a dead
whore stuffed in the springs of the bed.

804
01:08:35,904 --> 01:08:38,113
There's rooms blazing afire.

805
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,657
There's a big fat needle
from God knows where,

806
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:43,660
stuck in my leg, infecting me
with God knows what.

807
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:47,664
And finally, there's me, walkin'
out the door right fuckin' now.

808
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:51,919
Buenas noches.

809
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:56,131
- Is that the penthouse?
- Yes, it is.

810
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:57,966
It's the Chester Rush party.
They want something.

811
01:08:58,176 --> 01:09:03,847
Well, tough titty. They're just gonna
have to whistle, because I'm off.

812
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:06,183
Now, Ted, wait a minute.
I know you're freaked.

813
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:08,602
I know you're stressed.
You had a real bad night.

814
01:09:08,812 --> 01:09:14,399
Oh, yes, Betty.
I've had a real bad night.

815
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:18,278
The only thing I ask is that you take care of
Chester Rush, and then you can leave.

816
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:21,406
- I don't feel like it!
- Ted, he's a very important guest of the hotel.

817
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:23,408
In fact, he's the most
important guest of the hotel.

818
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:26,036
The Mon Signor used to be
a haven for movie stars.

819
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:28,413
Through the Thirties, Forties
and first half of the Fifties,

820
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:31,500
more movie stars, if you break it down
on a night-by-night basis,

821
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:34,002
stayed at the Mon Signor than
any other hotel in Hollywood.

822
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:36,004
Now, we had some hard times
in the Eighties,

823
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:38,173
even though we were the official
hotel of Cannon Pictures,

824
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:40,092
but we're comin' back strong
in the Nineties.

825
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:42,678
And a movie star clientele
is important to that comeback.

826
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:45,347
- Now, you look here...
- He probably just wants some champagne.

827
01:09:45,557 --> 01:09:48,892
You can do that, can't you?
Ted. Just take care of him.

828
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:51,478
The entire staff of
the Mon Signor is begging you.

829
01:09:51,688 --> 01:09:57,025
Okay. But you get your ass
down here pronto!

830
01:09:57,235 --> 01:10:00,237
You're a good man, Ted. Thanks.

831
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:13,083
Hello, Mr. Rush.
Sorry for the delay.

832
01:10:13,293 --> 01:10:15,085
How can I help you?

833
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:34,271
Get your skanky asses
the fuck outta here!

834
01:10:56,878 --> 01:10:58,879
Room service.

835
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:03,592
Hello, Theodore.

836
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:11,058
- What the f-fuck are you doing here?
- Havin' a drink.

837
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:13,477
Is Sigfried here?

838
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:16,480
Are you kidding? He'll probably
be asleep 'til Christmas.

839
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:18,815
Hey, everybody.
The bellboy is here.

840
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:22,569
- The bellboy's here!
- Oh, my God! Shit!

841
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:26,615
- Happy New Year!
- Entra! Entra!

842
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:29,451
Hey, bellboy!

843
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:35,207
Mr. Rush,
I'm sorry I'm late.

844
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:37,751
But I, I think you'll find
I have everything you need.

845
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:42,172
No problema, el bellboy.
No problema.

846
01:11:42,382 --> 01:11:45,342
- His name is Theodore.
- Actually, it's not Theodore. It's Ted.

847
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:49,137
- It's Ted, sir.
- So, Ted, the bellboy,

848
01:11:49,347 --> 01:11:51,974
would you care for some champagne
as I was saying?

849
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:54,059
All right, that wasn't
what I was saying.

850
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:56,603
- But would you care for some champagne?
- Um, I'm on duty, sir.

851
01:11:56,813 --> 01:12:00,273
Duty, smooty, come on. It's like
Cristal. It's the very best they make.

852
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:04,444
I didn't like champagne
'til I had Cristal. Now I love it.

853
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:06,530
- Come on!
- If I must, sir.

854
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:09,408
- Yes. As I was saying, chin-chin.
- Chin-chin.

855
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:12,285
For our purposes, promptness
is far behind thoroughness.

856
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:15,622
Drink up, lad.

857
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:17,749
- What do you say?
- Ah, thank you, sir.

858
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:20,585
No, not thank you. What do you say
about the tasty beverage?

859
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:22,671
Um, oh,
it's very good.

860
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:24,756
It's fucking good, Ted.
Fucking good!

861
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:26,800
- Let's try it again, shall we?
- Got a light?

862
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:29,219
Okay, so, Ted, what do you think
about that tasty beverage?

863
01:12:29,429 --> 01:12:31,096
It's fucking good!

864
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:34,599
It's fucking Cristal.
Everything else is piss.

865
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:36,977
Bellboy.
Bellboy. Bellboy!

866
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:40,313
Shut up. Shut up! Shh! Shut up!
You're makin' my friend Ted nervous.

867
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:43,942
Chill out, dude.
Pay no attention to Norman here.

868
01:12:44,152 --> 01:12:46,945
He's just... That's from Quadrophenia.
He's just fuckin' with you.

869
01:12:47,155 --> 01:12:49,948
Now me, personally,
when I think of bellboy,

870
01:12:50,158 --> 01:12:52,951
I think of The Bellboy
with Jerry Lewis.

871
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:56,705
- Did you ever see that film, Ted?
- Um... no, sir.

872
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:59,332
Oh, you should. It's one
of Jerry's better movies.

873
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:02,002
He doesn't say a word
through the entire film.

874
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:05,338
It's a completely
silent performance.

875
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:07,799
Now how many actors
can pull that off?

876
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:11,803
I gotta tell you, that guy,
he's gotta go to France to get respect.

877
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:13,847
That says it all
about America right there.

878
01:13:14,057 --> 01:13:16,892
Just that one little sentence says
it all about America right there.

879
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:20,020
The minute Jerry Lewis dies, every
newspaper in this fuckin' country...

880
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:22,481
is gonna be writin' articles
callin' the man a genius.

881
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:25,525
It's not right. It's not right
and it's not fuckin' fair!

882
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:30,197
But why should that surprise anybody?
When the hell has America ever been fair?

883
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:34,743
We might be right every once in awhile,
but we're very rarely fair.

884
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:41,958
Oh. Um... where
shall I put this, sir?

885
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,296
You in a hurry there, Ted?

886
01:13:46,506 --> 01:13:50,884
Uh, well, um...
Not particularly.

887
01:13:51,094 --> 01:13:53,804
Good there! Okay, then gotta stop
playin' "Beat the Clock."

888
01:13:54,013 --> 01:13:57,099
Okay. Let me introduce you to everybody.
Now, see that girl over there?

889
01:13:57,308 --> 01:13:59,101
All right, that's
our friend from downstairs.

890
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:01,394
We just met her at the pool.
You seem to be acquainted.

891
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:04,022
Yeah, Theodore and I go
way back, don't we, Theodore?

892
01:14:04,232 --> 01:14:06,358
Actually, the name's Ted, Angela.

893
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:10,403
I only let people with loaded guns
pointed at my head call me Theodore.

894
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:13,323
The man sittin' in this chair
with the Jim Beam in his hand,

895
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:16,326
yellin' "Bellboy" at you
is Norman.

896
01:14:16,536 --> 01:14:20,747
Norman, say hello to Ted.

897
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:22,916
- What's up, Ted?
- What's up, sir?

898
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:26,837
And the sociable son of a bitch
in that room over there is Leo.

899
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:29,756
And the person on the other end of
the phone is his lovely wife Ellen.

900
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:32,092
- Leo!
- What?

901
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,427
- Say hello to Ted the bellboy.
- Hold on a second. What?

902
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:38,515
- Say hello to Ted the bellboy.
- Here. Come here.

903
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:42,561
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Leo, Leo, Leo, L-Leo, L-Leo!

904
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:45,397
- Leo, that is Ted the bellboy.
- That's me.

905
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:48,275
The bellboy we called
about 20, 25 minutes ago.

906
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:51,236
Oh, Ted the bellboy.
Well, my goodness.

907
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:54,614
- Glad you could make it, chum.
- Glad I could be here.

908
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:57,659
Ellen, what does punctuality
have to do with love?

909
01:14:57,869 --> 01:15:00,579
- Which brings me to me.
- Could you explain that to me, please?

910
01:15:00,788 --> 01:15:04,624
Chester Rush, Ted.
Pleased to meet ya.

911
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:07,627
- I'm pleased to meet you, sir.
- Oh, Chester.

912
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:10,213
Not "sir."
Chester.

913
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:13,216
Chester? Oh, Chester.

914
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:16,178
Um, terribly sorry I haven't
seen the movie yet, sir, but...

915
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:18,305
No worries.
No worries at all.

916
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,307
Don't worry.
Don't be sorry about that.

917
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:23,268
You know, it's just, that's
why God invented video. No problem.

918
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:25,645
- You got a point, sir.
- But you know what?

919
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:28,815
A lot of people did see it. Whole lot
of motherfuckers saw that movie.

920
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:30,817
- Didn't they? Didn't they?
- A whole lot...

921
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:35,906
Lot of motherfuckers
saw The Wacky Detective.

922
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:39,826
The Wacky Detective, sir.

923
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:42,162
- Who drank out of this bottle last?
- Uh?

924
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,456
I said, "Who drank out
of this bottle last?"

925
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:45,999
What the fuck's wrong?

926
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:48,335
It's fuckin' flat, man.
That's what's fuckin' wrong.

927
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:52,505
Goddamn Cristal is fuckin' flat. There ain't
a goddamn bubble left in the fuckin' bottle, man.

928
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:55,800
- Jesus Christ! What the fuck is goin' on here?
- Chill out, man.

929
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:58,845
Who fuckin'... Who... Fuck...
Who didn't put the cork in the bottle?

930
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:01,306
All right? Somebody!
I didn't do this!

931
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:03,391
I was drinkin' out of
that other bottle there.

932
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,602
Somebody didn't put the fuckin' cork
in the bottle. Who didn't put it in?

933
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:07,646
- Chester, do you want me to open another
bottle of champ... - Who didn't put it in?

934
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:09,731
Do you want me to open
another bottle of champagne?

935
01:16:09,941 --> 01:16:11,733
No, don't you fuckin'
open another bottle!

936
01:16:11,943 --> 01:16:14,069
I-I-I got enough right here.
Fucking shit, man.

937
01:16:14,278 --> 01:16:16,363
God, we've opened
enough fucking bottles!

938
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:18,907
- Do you know how much this shit costs?
No! You don't. - Yes, I do.

939
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:21,076
No! You don't!
No! You don't!

940
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:25,705
'Cause it's fucking free, man. It's just
fucking free to you fucking assholes.

941
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:28,458
Shit. I give and I give
and I give and I give and I give.

942
01:16:28,668 --> 01:16:33,046
What was I talkin' about?

943
01:16:33,256 --> 01:16:36,216
Um, you were saying
that The Wacky Detective...

944
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,343
was a very popular movie.

945
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:43,265
Yes, it was. And it was popular...
very, very popular... before video.

946
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:47,644
It was popular before foreign!
It was popular before p-pay TV.

947
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:51,273
And before free TV.
Before all that shit!

948
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,359
- The Wacky Detective was making...
- Ellen, I'm sorry, okay?

949
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:57,821
Leo! Leo. What was the final take
on domestic?

950
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,948
$72. 1 million.

951
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:02,617
- $72. 1 million.
- Ellen, I'm sorry.

952
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:05,870
That's fucking asses
in fucking seats.

953
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:07,914
You know, it's not your fault.
I mean, they hit you both barrels.

954
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:10,583
But you know, fuck, you know, I just
would like a little consideration.

955
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:13,545
And my new one,
The Dog Catcher,

956
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:16,089
which, by the way, is testing
right through the ceiling,

957
01:17:16,299 --> 01:17:19,217
all right, is projected
to gross a hundred.

958
01:17:19,427 --> 01:17:23,638
- The Dog Catcher.
- The Dog Catcher, Chester.

959
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:30,520
- Oh, thank you, sir.
- That's the good stuff.

960
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:33,398
Now, take a look at some of
these goodies you brought us, okay?

961
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:37,944
- Um, f-far be it... Far be it for me,
uh, Chester... - Uh-huh.

962
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:41,072
But I was just wondering if you could
tell me, what is all that stuff for?

963
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,450
Hey, one thing at a time, man.
I'm not a frog, and you're not a bunny.

964
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:46,077
- So let's not jump ahead.
- νery good, sir.

965
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:47,203
Norman, Norman, Norman,
come on, come on.

966
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:48,747
I think you might want to look
at some of this shit.

967
01:17:48,956 --> 01:17:51,875
Hey, you damn skimpy.
All right, men.

968
01:17:54,545 --> 01:17:57,505
All right, man.
Tell it.

969
01:17:59,133 --> 01:18:01,760
A block of wood.

970
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:04,554
Continue.

971
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:07,140
- Three nails.
- Why three nails?

972
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:11,144
That's how many Peter Lorre
asked for. Continue, Ted.

973
01:18:11,354 --> 01:18:13,438
A ball of twine.

974
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:16,566
Well, that is definitely
a ball of twine. Continue!

975
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:20,528
A bucket... of ice.

976
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:22,530
- You into it?
- I'm into it.

977
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,657
All right.
Go on!

978
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:29,913
- A doughnut.
- That's for me.

979
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:37,587
- A club sandwich.
- That is mine.

980
01:18:39,757 --> 01:18:44,427
And... a hatchet!

981
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:49,682
"A hatchet as sharp as the devil
himself," is what I asked for.

982
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:52,644
Well, sir... Chester...
you be the judge.

983
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:56,231
No, no, no, no, no.
I'll be the judge.

984
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:58,650
- Careful, sir.
- What do you think?

985
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:02,487
It's a sharp motherfucker.
Forget the nails and the twine.

986
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:06,366
Bring all this other bullshit
over to the bar. Come on.

987
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:09,244
- Let's go. Pronto, man.
- You heard him, Ted. Go ahead.

988
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:12,372
- Right you are, sir.
- Norman? Yeah?

989
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:16,209
Yes, it's my job.
Yes, it's my fucking job. You know that.

990
01:19:16,419 --> 01:19:19,462
He wanted to stay out late. I can't...
I went to the Monkey Bar, all right?

991
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:21,923
Don't yell... I'm not yelling!

992
01:19:22,133 --> 01:19:25,093
Hey! I'm not yellin'!
You're the one that's fuckin' yellin'!

993
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:26,761
Fuck... Don't hang up on me!

994
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:30,140
Ellen, please don't hang up on me.
Please don't hang up on me.

995
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:32,767
Goddamn it! I swear to fucking God,
if you hang up on me...

996
01:19:32,977 --> 01:19:35,353
You cock-fucking New York bitch.
Fuckin' call better be genuine,

997
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:36,896
'cause I'm gonna get a divorce!

998
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:38,940
- Yo, Leo?
- Fuck!

999
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:42,402
- Another fucking Honeymooners goin' on in there.
- Fuckin', fuckin' shit, man!

1000
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:46,406
What the fuck is wrong... What the fuck
is wrong with the fuckin' bitch, man?

1001
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:50,076
I'm gonna take the fuckin' car. I'm
gonna drive up to fuckin' Mulholland.

1002
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:54,539
I am gonna fuckin' drag her fuckin' ass and
throw her down Benedict fuckin' Canyon, man!

1003
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:58,460
- You're still married, man?
- Yeah. I don't fucking know anymore.

1004
01:19:58,669 --> 01:20:01,254
I swear to Christ, Norman.
I fuckin' swear to God, man.

1005
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:04,382
What the fuck is wrong... I treat this fuckin'
bitch like a queen! You know that, man.

1006
01:20:04,592 --> 01:20:06,593
- I know that.
- So I had a little fuckin' too much to drink!

1007
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:10,138
It's fuckin' New Year's Eve. New Year's
Eve. I can't fuckin' drive home.

1008
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:12,640
Okay, Ellen, I'm sorry.
I'm fuckin' sorry about that.

1009
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:16,311
What do you want me to do? Get in a fuckin' car,
and go run over six or seven fuckin' kids?

1010
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:18,605
That'd be real fuckin' nice.

1011
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:22,650
Man, what the fuck is the matter
with this bitch?

1012
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:25,653
Fuck!

1013
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:27,655
What the fuck
is all this?

1014
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,657
Block of wood, bucket
of ice and a hatchet, sir.

1015
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:32,452
Get the fuck outta here.
Chester, talk to me. Norman?

1016
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:35,705
We now return you to
The Man From Rio already in progress.

1017
01:20:35,915 --> 01:20:37,707
Oh, my fucking dick
is hard already.

1018
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:39,751
Tell me, Norman,
you're gonna do this shit!

1019
01:20:39,919 --> 01:20:43,129
- I am gonna do it.
- Oh, you are my fuckin' hero.

1020
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:45,673
They better, after talkin' about it
all night. I wanna see a show.

1021
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:48,009
- Come here. Give me your motherfuckin'...
- All right then.

1022
01:20:48,219 --> 01:20:50,637
- Well, if that's everything.
- I got Cedars lined up, man.

1023
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:52,972
I got a doctor waitin'
in the fuckin' emergency.

1024
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:56,851
Fuck the emergency, man. I'm gonna grab
his motherfucking car from him.

1025
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:59,521
Just in case.
Hey, just in fucking case.

1026
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:02,232
- I'll just be off back downstairs, sir.
- Not so fast.

1027
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:04,692
- Fuckin' treat that bitch like a queen, man.
- We're gonna walk back...

1028
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:06,778
- to this little bar here.
- I told you to dump her, didn't I?

1029
01:21:06,987 --> 01:21:09,197
We're gonna sit down, 'cause
we ain't quite through yet.

1030
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:13,034
Leo. Sit on this little red stool.
Sit down on this little red stool,

1031
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:18,748
while I explain the festivities
of the evening to you.

1032
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:21,709
- All right.
- Um, sir?

1033
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,711
- Uh-huh.
- A word in your ear, sir.

1034
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:25,797
- Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.
- Excusez-moi.

1035
01:21:26,006 --> 01:21:28,883
- I treat that bitch like a queen, man.
- Chester.

1036
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:31,010
That shit don't help,
treating a woman like a queen.

1037
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:35,306
- I'm fuckin' working.
- As long as you don't break up the furniture,

1038
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:37,433
I don't give a fuck
what you do.

1039
01:21:37,601 --> 01:21:39,435
Took all your money.
Gonna take your kids and house.

1040
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:42,480
As far as I'm concerned,
go ahead, trash the place!

1041
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:45,525
Oh, but, look, let me explain
what we're talkin' about.

1042
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:48,069
Sir, sir, you don't have
to explain anything to me.

1043
01:21:48,279 --> 01:21:52,865
Whatever constitutes a good time, as far
as you guys are concerned, that's your business.

1044
01:21:53,075 --> 01:21:57,495
Well, no, it's your business too, Ted,
because we want you to take part.

1045
01:22:00,374 --> 01:22:04,002
Take part in what, sir?

1046
01:22:04,211 --> 01:22:07,880
Chester, your way of breakin' the news
to him gently is scarin' the fuck outta him.

1047
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:09,882
- Think so?
- Just spit it out.

1048
01:22:10,092 --> 01:22:11,926
Okay, okay, here we go.
Okay.

1049
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:14,721
Thing is, Ted,
first off,

1050
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:17,599
there's nothing homosexual
about what we want you to do.

1051
01:22:17,808 --> 01:22:19,726
I mean, I was thinkin'
you might be thinkin'...

1052
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:21,936
that we want you to do somethin'
like weird sex thing,

1053
01:22:22,146 --> 01:22:24,522
you know, like, suck us off,
pee on us, shit like that.

1054
01:22:24,732 --> 01:22:26,774
Nothing, nothing could be
further from the truth.

1055
01:22:26,984 --> 01:22:29,402
- Can I just jump in here for a second?
- No. No.

1056
01:22:29,612 --> 01:22:32,363
My kind of way of telling him
is kind of going all around the world.

1057
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:34,699
- But it's the journey that's worth it.
- Yeah, well, I see that.

1058
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:37,702
But he's been here for 15 minutes and you have,
you know, talked about everything but...

1059
01:22:37,911 --> 01:22:40,747
- What do you care?
- Why don't you just shut the fuck up, bitch?

1060
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,915
- "Bitch"?
- Bitch!

1061
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:45,585
Uh, excuse me, aren't you the one who's
being paid to suck his cock, cork boy?

1062
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:49,505
- Whoa!
- Cork boy, man! Business card!

1063
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:52,342
I see a new business card.

1064
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:54,636
Excuse me, if it
please the court.

1065
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:58,723
Allow me to present
our intentions to Theodore.

1066
01:22:58,932 --> 01:23:02,644
- I second the nomination.
- I move that nomination be closed!

1067
01:23:02,853 --> 01:23:04,646
- Thank you.
- The court is yours, Leo.

1068
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:06,814
Thank you very much,
Chester.

1069
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:11,653
- Ted, you ever seen any of them
old Alfred Hitchcock episodes? - Yes, sir.

1070
01:23:11,862 --> 01:23:15,865
You ever see the one called The Man From
Rio with Peter Lorre and Steve McQueen?

1071
01:23:16,075 --> 01:23:17,950
- Uh...
- Ah, if you saw it, you'd remember it.

1072
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:20,286
It's called The Man From Rio
with Peter Lorre, Steve McQueen.

1073
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:23,623
Anyway, Peter Lorre makes
a bet with Steve McQueen...

1074
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:27,001
that Steve McQueen can't light his
cigarette lighter ten times in a row.

1075
01:23:27,211 --> 01:23:29,837
Now, if Steve McQueen lights his
cigarette lighter ten times in a row,

1076
01:23:30,047 --> 01:23:31,839
he wins Peter Lorre's
new car.

1077
01:23:32,049 --> 01:23:35,843
But if he does not light his
cigarette lighter ten times in a row,

1078
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:40,515
Peter Lorre gets to chop off
Steve McQueen's little pinky.

1079
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:44,769
Norman and Chester here
just made that same bet.

1080
01:23:44,978 --> 01:23:48,022
Norman has bet
his pinky...

1081
01:23:48,232 --> 01:23:52,151
that he can light his cigarette lighter
ten times in a row.

1082
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:54,153
If he does,

1083
01:23:54,321 --> 01:23:58,533
he wins Chester's
1964 Chevy Chevelle...

1084
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:01,536
red, fuckin',
beautiful car.

1085
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:06,624
If he doesn't, chop off
his fuckin' pinky. What do you say?

1086
01:24:13,424 --> 01:24:15,216
You guys are drunk.

1087
01:24:15,426 --> 01:24:18,136
- Yes!
- Of course! Of course we're drunk!

1088
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:20,138
Teddy, that's why we're here,
but that does not mean...

1089
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:22,390
that we don't know what the fuck
we're talking about.

1090
01:24:22,558 --> 01:24:24,434
I'm gonna tell you what
the fuck I'm talkin' about.

1091
01:24:24,601 --> 01:24:26,728
I'm gonna tell you what the fuck
I'm talkin' about.

1092
01:24:26,937 --> 01:24:29,981
I drive a motherfucking Honda
that my sister sold me.

1093
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:35,194
You hear what I'm saying? A little
white motherfuckin' Honda Civic!

1094
01:24:35,404 --> 01:24:37,530
You see this shit?

1095
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:39,741
- "Hollywood's hottest new star...
- That's me.

1096
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:42,076
Next to America's
hottest old car."

1097
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:44,620
- That's the car I own.
- Are you listenin' to me? Are you?

1098
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:48,875
Goddamn shit!
Are you listening to me?

1099
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:51,169
Now you take a good long look
at that there machine...

1100
01:24:51,378 --> 01:24:53,838
that this motherfucker
over here's standin' next to.

1101
01:24:54,047 --> 01:24:58,718
That's a 1964 nigger-red,
ragtop Chevy Chevelle.

1102
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:02,930
And I love that car more than
I love hips, lips or fingertips.

1103
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:07,727
Cut to: We're sittin' here
celebratin', gettin' high,

1104
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:10,146
- drinking champagne...
- Drinking Cristal.

1105
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:12,523
When you're drinking champagne,
you're drinking champagne.

1106
01:25:12,733 --> 01:25:15,151
When you're drinking Cristal,
you say you're drinking Cristal.

1107
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:18,404
Whatever that pissity-ass thing is,
we are drinking it, you know.

1108
01:25:18,614 --> 01:25:20,448
And we are watching TV.

1109
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:22,992
What, what? Hey, hey, hey.
When all of a sudden,

1110
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:26,871
We flip on Steve McQueen, Peter
Lorre being fuckin' badasses.

1111
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:28,873
- Badass!
- Badasses!

1112
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:31,751
And I look over at this
funny-looking motherfucker over here,

1113
01:25:31,919 --> 01:25:35,755
and I say, "I'd do that
for the Chevelle."

1114
01:25:35,923 --> 01:25:40,593
- I'm funny.
- And that's when Chester says...

1115
01:25:42,012 --> 01:25:45,389
"Oh, really?"

1116
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:51,646
Well, you guys wouldn't be doing something
this stupid unless you were really fucking drunk.

1117
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:53,731
We already told you
we were drunk, Ted.

1118
01:25:53,941 --> 01:25:55,775
That goes without
motherfucking saying.

1119
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:58,653
'Cause if we wasn't drunk,
we'd probably chicken out.

1120
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:01,322
When you're fucked up,
you don't lie.

1121
01:26:01,532 --> 01:26:03,616
Man, you tell
the fuckin' truth.

1122
01:26:03,826 --> 01:26:05,785
You want to know what
the fuckin' truth is?

1123
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:08,621
The fuckin' truth is, my
lucky Zippo is gonna win me...

1124
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:11,165
Chester's fucking car.

1125
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:14,919
Which brings us to your part
in this little wager, Ted.

1126
01:26:15,128 --> 01:26:17,004
I don't have a part, sir.

1127
01:26:20,968 --> 01:26:23,553
That's it. Like my old granddaddy
used to always say,

1128
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,596
"The less a man makes
declarative statements,

1129
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:28,391
the less apt he is to look
foolish in retrospect."

1130
01:26:28,559 --> 01:26:31,310
- That's quite brilliant, sir.
- Ah, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1131
01:26:31,478 --> 01:26:33,980
Thing is, there are some inherent
obstacles in this undertaking.

1132
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:36,148
Aside from the obvious.

1133
01:26:36,358 --> 01:26:40,111
First of which is being the fact that
I'm not like Peter Lorre on that TV show.

1134
01:26:40,279 --> 01:26:43,531
I'm not some sick fuck travelin'
the countryside collecting fingers.

1135
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:45,533
All right, you know,
we're all buddies here.

1136
01:26:45,742 --> 01:26:49,161
No one wants Norman to lose his finger.
We just want to chop it off.

1137
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:51,205
You know, if fate doesn't
smile on old Norman,

1138
01:26:51,415 --> 01:26:53,958
we'll put that fucker on ice,
whisk it right to the hospital,

1139
01:26:54,167 --> 01:26:56,419
where in all likelihood they'll be able
to sew it right back on.

1140
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:58,713
Well, hopefully, sir.

1141
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:01,465
Yeah, well, they sewed that guy's dick back on.
They can sew Norman's pinky back on.

1142
01:27:01,675 --> 01:27:03,843
- Yeah, how hard can it be?
- Yeah, good point.

1143
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:06,387
So, Norman, he's,
he's taken care of, you know.

1144
01:27:06,597 --> 01:27:08,890
His interests
have been looked after.

1145
01:27:09,099 --> 01:27:12,685
My interests,
on the other hand, have not.

1146
01:27:12,895 --> 01:27:17,356
I am as emotionally attached to my car
as Norman is physically to his finger.

1147
01:27:17,566 --> 01:27:21,027
That's a very fuckin' piece of expensive
machinery I'm putting on this wager.

1148
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:23,654
And, you know, if I lose, I lose.
That's fine. That's no problem.

1149
01:27:23,864 --> 01:27:27,074
I have no problem with that. I'm a big boy.
I knew exactly what the hell I was doing.

1150
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:31,329
But if I win,
I wanna win. All right?

1151
01:27:31,538 --> 01:27:35,750
If Norman lights his cigarette lighter
ten times in a fuckin' row,

1152
01:27:35,918 --> 01:27:39,629
he's gonna have no emotional problems
whatsoever about taking my car keys.

1153
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:44,550
But if I win,

1154
01:27:44,718 --> 01:27:49,472
well, it's not inconceivable
that at the last minute...

1155
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:52,516
maybe neither Leo or I...

1156
01:27:52,726 --> 01:27:55,937
will be able to...
wield the axe.

1157
01:27:56,146 --> 01:27:59,190
- A hatchet, sir.
- Wield the hatchet.

1158
01:27:59,358 --> 01:28:02,443
Which brings us
full circle to you, Ted.

1159
01:28:02,653 --> 01:28:06,405
Clear-eyed Ted. Sober Ted.

1160
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:08,699
Complete-stranger Ted.

1161
01:28:08,909 --> 01:28:11,035
Impartial Ted.

1162
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:15,456
Just-met-us-and-couldn't-
give-a-fuck-about-us Ted.

1163
01:28:15,666 --> 01:28:20,419
We want you
to be the dice man.

1164
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:25,508
Hell of a night, huh, Ted?

1165
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:30,429
I've got to get out of here.

1166
01:28:31,473 --> 01:28:33,724
Money!

1167
01:28:37,604 --> 01:28:41,607
Ted, I got a $100 bill here
with your name on it,

1168
01:28:41,817 --> 01:28:44,610
whether you do
what we ask or not.

1169
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:47,655
Just to sit back down in
that chair for one minute more.

1170
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:51,617
I am not gonna cut off
Norman's little pinky!

1171
01:28:51,827 --> 01:28:53,619
Well, maybe you will
and maybe you won't.

1172
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:56,038
But that has nothin' to do
with this $100 bill in my hand.

1173
01:28:56,248 --> 01:28:59,417
In fact, you can tell us all to go fuck off
and walk right out that goddamn door.

1174
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:01,544
But if you wait 60 seconds
before you do it,

1175
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:05,131
you're gonna be $100 richer.

1176
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:07,341
Ted, you're gonna do
whatever you wanna do.

1177
01:29:07,551 --> 01:29:10,886
All we're askin' is that you
indulge us for one minute more.

1178
01:29:11,096 --> 01:29:13,723
My friend Chester here is willing
to pay you for that minute.

1179
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:17,560
Ted, take the money.

1180
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:26,610
Now, let me get this straight.

1181
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:29,405
I sit on that stool, listen
to what you have to say for 60 seconds,

1182
01:29:29,614 --> 01:29:32,450
- and I get $100?
- Correct.

1183
01:29:32,659 --> 01:29:35,870
And afterwards I can walk out
that door, no hard feelings?

1184
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:37,955
None whatsoever.

1185
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:42,334
You got a deal.

1186
01:29:42,544 --> 01:29:45,796
- Yes!
- Oh, yes, yes! Yes, yes, yes,!

1187
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:47,798
Ted, good answer.
Sit right down.

1188
01:29:48,008 --> 01:29:51,844
All right. Leo,
you be the timekeeper.

1189
01:29:52,054 --> 01:29:54,847
Norman, give me
your watch.

1190
01:29:55,057 --> 01:29:59,685
Let me know when a minute ends
and when it begins.

1191
01:29:59,895 --> 01:30:01,812
- You got it.
- Ah.

1192
01:30:02,022 --> 01:30:04,440
- Okay.
- Gentlemen, start your engines.

1193
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:14,200
- Begin.
- Okay, Ted, pay attention here.

1194
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:17,036
I'm gonna make two piles here
on the bar. One pile which is yours.

1195
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:19,580
And another pile
which could be yours.

1196
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:22,208
And what you have to realize
is we're gonna do this thing...

1197
01:30:22,417 --> 01:30:26,378
one way or the other.

1198
01:30:26,588 --> 01:30:30,508
Whether it's you who holds
the axe or a Mexican maid...

1199
01:30:30,717 --> 01:30:33,385
or some bum
we yank off the street.

1200
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:36,347
- You can buy a whole lot of soup with that pile.
- Shh! I'm the closer here.

1201
01:30:36,556 --> 01:30:38,724
All right. I'm a little me...
Um, I've lost count.

1202
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:41,018
- How much is on the bar here?
- Six hundred.

1203
01:30:41,228 --> 01:30:46,190
Okay. Ted, do you know how long it takes
the average American to count to 600?

1204
01:30:46,358 --> 01:30:50,402
- It's a rhetorical question, Ted.
- No, sir.

1205
01:30:50,612 --> 01:30:53,739
About one minute less than
it takes to count to 700.

1206
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:57,243
Now, Ted, a person's life is filled
with a zillion little experiences.

1207
01:30:57,452 --> 01:31:00,871
Some which are insignificant, have no
meaning, and, you know, you forget them.

1208
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:05,292
Others which you remember for
the rest of your natural life.

1209
01:31:05,502 --> 01:31:10,047
Now, since what we're proposing
here is so unusual,

1210
01:31:10,257 --> 01:31:13,217
so outside the norm,

1211
01:31:13,426 --> 01:31:17,555
that this is a good bet that this is going
to be one of those incidents that sticks.

1212
01:31:17,764 --> 01:31:21,559
So, since you're gonna be stuck remembering this
for the rest of your life,

1213
01:31:21,768 --> 01:31:24,937
you have to decide
what that memory will be.

1214
01:31:25,147 --> 01:31:28,440
So, Ted, are you going to
remember for the next 40 years,

1215
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:30,526
give or take a decade,

1216
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:34,947
that you refused $1,000
for one second's worth of work?

1217
01:31:35,157 --> 01:31:40,536
Or that you made $1,000
for one second's worth of work?

1218
01:31:40,745 --> 01:31:42,538
Time!

1219
01:31:42,747 --> 01:31:45,958
So, Ted, what's it gonna be?

1220
01:31:46,168 --> 01:31:48,752
- Okay.
- Yes!

1221
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,921
Always be closing!

1222
01:31:51,131 --> 01:31:53,966
- Whoo! - Right here, right now!
Before I change my mind!

1223
01:31:54,176 --> 01:31:56,635
Hear, hear.
Go. Let's go.

1224
01:31:56,845 --> 01:32:00,431
- Get this shit over and done with.
- Ahh!

1225
01:32:00,599 --> 01:32:03,726
Perfect, perfect, perfect. This is
one of those moments in time...

1226
01:32:03,935 --> 01:32:07,021
none of us are
ever gonna forget.

1227
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:10,274
- Norman, are you ready?
- I'm ready.

1228
01:32:10,442 --> 01:32:14,111
- Ted, are you ready?
- Ready.

1229
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:17,239
Okeydokey.
Norman...

1230
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:20,367
begin.

1231
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:24,163
Aaah!

1232
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:26,373
My finger!
My fuckin' finger!

1233
01:32:26,583 --> 01:32:28,375
Chester,
my fuckin' finger, man!

1234
01:32:28,585 --> 01:32:30,377
He cut off my fuckin' finger!

1235
01:32:30,587 --> 01:32:33,255
Oh! It hurts!

1236
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:38,469
My fuckin' finger, Chester!
He cut off my fuckin' finger!

1237
01:32:38,637 --> 01:32:42,806
Aaah! Oh, Leo!

1238
01:32:50,023 --> 01:32:51,899
Call Cedars, man!
Call fuckin' Cedars!

1239
01:32:52,108 --> 01:32:54,318
Wrap it up! Wrap it up!

1240
01:32:54,527 --> 01:32:57,988
Uh, yes, hi.
Could I talk to Don Levine, please?

1241
01:32:58,198 --> 01:33:02,826
Why'd you let me
do this? Why'd you let me do this?

1242
01:33:06,164 --> 01:33:08,707
What? What do you mean
he's in surgery?

1243
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:11,418
He was expecting my call.
He was supposed to be there.

1244
01:33:11,628 --> 01:33:15,673
What? Who the fuck has plastic surgery
at 6:30 in the morning on New Year's Eve?

1245
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:24,890
- Leo! Leo! - I need you to stand still!
I'll be right back! Hold it!

1246
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:28,143
- Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!
- All right!

1247
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:30,854
Oh! Leo!

1248
01:33:33,566 --> 01:33:35,359
I forgot the finger!
I gotta get the...

1249
01:33:35,568 --> 01:33:37,528
It's the finger!

1250
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:46,161
I got the finger!
I got it! I got it!

1251
01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:51,709
Here! I got the finger
right here! You're on it!

1252
01:33:51,876 --> 01:33:54,545
Come on, come on!
The fuckin' door's closin'!

1253
01:33:54,754 --> 01:33:57,089
Here. Just put
some fuckin' ice in it.

1254
01:33:57,299 --> 01:33:59,133
All right, let's go.
Let's go! Let's go!

1255
01:33:59,342 --> 01:34:01,135
Let's go! Come on!
Get up, get up!

1256
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:03,262
- I'm gonna go back to my room.
- Are you comin' or not?

1257
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:05,264
- No, it's been fun. I'll see ya.
- Oh!

1258
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:07,349
Close the fuckin' door!
