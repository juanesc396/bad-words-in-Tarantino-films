1
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,904
This man is worth 500 dollars.

2
00:00:39,542 --> 00:00:41,756
And this man's going to collect.

3
00:00:42,082 --> 00:00:45,153
He's Jake Cahill
and he lives by

4
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,439
Bounty Law.

5
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:49,266
You don't ever bring men
alive, now do you, Jake?

6
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:51,504
Not when there's three
of them and one of me.

7
00:00:57,027 --> 00:00:58,837
What are you lookin' at,
bounty killer?

8
00:00:58,877 --> 00:01:01,965
Lookin' at an ugly owl hoot
'bout to get his jaw busted.

9
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:05,440
Amateurs try and
take men in alive.

10
00:01:07,747 --> 00:01:09,255
Amateurs usually don't make it.

11
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:12,242
Whether you're dead or alive,
you're just a dollar sign to

12
00:01:12,267 --> 00:01:15,053
Jake Cahill on
Bounty Law.

13
00:01:15,123 --> 00:01:18,294
Thursdays at 8:30.
Only on NBC.

14
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:23,241
Hello, everybody!

15
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,327
This is Allen Kincaid on
the set of the exciting hit

16
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,098
NBC and Screen Gems
television series

17
00:01:28,123 --> 00:01:29,214
Bounty Law.

18
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:31,034
Now, if you think
you're seeing double,

19
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,567
don't adjust your
television sets

20
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,592
because, well,
in a way, you are.

21
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,695
To my right is
Bounty Law series lead

22
00:01:36,728 --> 00:01:39,139
and Jake Cahill himself,
Rick Dalton.

23
00:01:39,185 --> 00:01:41,796
And to my left is Rick's
stunt double, Cliff Booth.

24
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,149
Welcome, gentlemen and

25
00:01:43,174 --> 00:01:44,705
thanks for taking the
time to visit with us.

26
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:46,245
Well, it's our pleasure, Al.

27
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,193
So, Rick, uh, explain
to the audience

28
00:01:48,218 --> 00:01:50,741
exactly what it is
a stunt double does.

29
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:52,592
Well...

30
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:56,425
Actors are required to do
a lot of dangerous stuff.

31
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:59,095
Say, Jake Cahill gets
shot off a horse...

32
00:01:59,277 --> 00:02:01,689
Now, can I fall off a horse?

33
00:02:01,736 --> 00:02:04,205
Yes, I can, yes, I have.

34
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:09,266
Let's say I fall off
wrong and I

35
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:12,847
and I sprain my wrist or I-
or I twist my ankle, now...

36
00:02:12,907 --> 00:02:15,208
that can put an undue
burden on production

37
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,772
'cause now maybe I
can't work for a week.

38
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:20,539
So, Cliff here is meant
to help carry the load.

39
00:02:20,589 --> 00:02:22,748
Is that, uh, how you
describe your job, Cliff?

40
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:24,510
What, carrying his load?

41
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:26,424
Yeah, that's about right.

42
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,787
Join me next week on the set
of The Dick Van Dyke Show

43
00:02:32,812 --> 00:02:34,560
where I'll be talking
to those comical cut-ups

44
00:02:34,585 --> 00:02:36,657
Morey Amsterdam
and Rose Marie.

45
00:02:36,705 --> 00:02:40,110
Till then, this is Allen Kincaid
signing off from Hollywood.

Hello, Mr. Schwarz.

Whoa, Gina.

a Rick Dalton
fucking film festival,

91
00:06:08,204 --> 00:06:09,886
I think I know who you are.

Rick. Oh, that your son?

Good to meet you.

We've worked together
since the, uh,

104
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:35,496
the last two seasons
of Bounty Law.

105
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:36,753
- Yeah.
- My car's in the shop.

Oh, fuck.

112
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:47,462
Sounds like a good friend.

00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:48,677
I try.

114
00:06:49,672 --> 00:06:52,244
I want to send you
greetings from my wife,

Mary Alice Schwarz.

116
00:06:54,753 --> 00:06:56,285
Oh, well, that's nice.

117
00:06:58,825 --> 00:06:59,992
Thanks a lot.

118
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,559
We had...

119
00:07:03,584 --> 00:07:07,361
a Rick Dalton double feature in
our screening room last night.

120
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:08,683
Oh, well...

121
00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:11,564
That's both flattering
and embarrassing.

122
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:13,490
What'd you see?

123
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:15,334

124

of Tanner and
The 14 Fists of McCluskey.

125
00:07:25,136 --> 00:07:26,422
I hope the uh...

126
00:07:26,636 --> 00:07:29,771
Rick Dalton uh, double
feature wasn't too uh...

127
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:31,742
painful for you and the-
and the missus.

128
00:07:31,802 --> 00:07:34,381
Oh, no. Painful. Stop.

00:07:34,781 --> 00:07:36,090

you know, the killing.

146

00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,925
three hours a day for two weeks.

164
00:09:43,953 --> 00:09:46,420
N-Not just 'cause I wanted
to look good in the picture

165
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:47,635
but because I was

166
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,929
I was shit scared of the
damn thing, to be honest.

167
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,831
Might fucking lose!

168
00:09:52,482 --> 00:09:53,998
Burn in a massive death!

169
00:09:55,687 --> 00:09:57,012
All right, that's too hot.

170
00:09:57,228 --> 00:09:58,992
Anything we could
do about that heat?

171
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,961
Rick, it's a flamethrower.

172
00:10:01,061 --> 00:10:02,183
Yeah.

173
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:04,874
So I came to the
office early today...

174
00:10:05,464 --> 00:10:06,898
and I watched

175
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:09,784
<i>two episodes of Bounty Law</i>

176
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,230
<i>on a 16mm.</i>

177
00:10:11,255 --> 00:10:12,669
Jodey Janus.

178
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,488
Wanted for cow rustling
in the state of Wyoming.

179
00:10:15,513 --> 00:10:18,372
425 dollars, dead or alive.

180
00:10:19,977 --> 00:10:22,470
And you brought him
here to collect.

181
00:10:23,037 --> 00:10:24,783
I don't even know
where here is.

182
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:26,997
This was the closest place.

183
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:30,231
Caught up with him about
five miles outside of town.

184
00:10:30,374 --> 00:10:32,065
So, bounty killer...

185
00:10:33,082 --> 00:10:35,106
the name of this
town is Janustown.

186
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:39,541
That boy you killed...

187
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:41,985
Jodey Janus...

188
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,309
he was the baby boy of
Major Nathan Maxwell Janus.

189
00:10:49,451 --> 00:10:53,443
Who is...
Major Nathan Maxwell Janus?

190
00:10:53,914 --> 00:10:58,517
Well, I'll be sure to
introduce you

191
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:00,366
when he gets here.

192
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:21,335
Bounty Law.

193
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,954

205
00:11:59,046 --> 00:12:01,887
guest shots on uh,
episodic TV shows

206
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,898
the last couple of years.

207
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:04,540
Yeah, yeah, uh...

208
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:08,009
I'm doin' a-a pilot
for CBS right now.

209
00:12:08,515 --> 00:12:10,056
It's called Lancer.

210
00:12:10,128 --> 00:12:11,263
I play the heavy.

211
00:12:11,288 --> 00:12:14,318
Did a... Ron Ely Tarzan
and uh...

212
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:16,465
Land of the Giants,
Green Hornet.

213
00:12:16,618 --> 00:12:18,237
I did that show...

214
00:12:18,356 --> 00:12:21,594
Bingo Martin with
that kid Scott Brown.

215
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:25,176
And I got a FBI
that airs this Sunday.

216
00:12:25,201 --> 00:12:28,893
You uh, you always play
the bad guy on these shows?

217
00:12:29,528 --> 00:12:30,663
Yeah.

218
00:12:31,305 --> 00:12:34,718
Mmm. So, and they have
a fight scene at the end?

219
00:12:34,857 --> 00:12:38,852
Well, not...
Land of the Giants or FBI

220
00:12:38,877 --> 00:12:40,566
but the rest, yeah.

221
00:12:40,807 --> 00:12:42,355
And you lose in the fight?

222
00:12:43,504 --> 00:12:45,520
Yeah, of course.
I'm the heavy

223
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:50,051
Oh... that's an old trick
pulled by the networks.

224
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:51,555
You take Bingo Martin

225
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,254
- for example.
- Mm-hmm.

226
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:56,347
So, you got a new guy
like Scott Brown.

227
00:12:56,728 --> 00:12:59,308
You want to build up
his bona fide.

228
00:12:59,956 --> 00:13:03,440
So you hire a guy from a
canceled show to play the heavy.

229
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:06,618
Then at the end of the
show when they fight...

230
00:13:07,145 --> 00:13:08,923
it's hero besting heavy.

231
00:13:09,174 --> 00:13:13,309
But, what the audience
sees is Bingo Martin...

232
00:13:13,968 --> 00:13:16,587
whipping Jake Cahill's ass.

233
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:18,087
You see?

234
00:13:18,396 --> 00:13:19,777
Then next week,

235
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,483
it's Ron Ely.

236
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,718
The next week it's...

237
00:13:23,864 --> 00:13:26,753
Bob Conrad wearing
his tight pants...

238
00:13:27,112 --> 00:13:28,280
kicking your ass.

239
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:29,470
Yeah.

240
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:32,956
Now in another couple of
years playing punching bag

241
00:13:32,981 --> 00:13:35,418
to every swinging dick
new to the network,

242
00:13:36,623 --> 00:13:38,861
it's gonna have a
psychological effect

243
00:13:38,956 --> 00:13:42,229
on how the audience
perceives you.

244
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:43,317
Right.

245
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:45,623
So, Rick...

246
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:48,337
who's gonna kick the shit
outta you next week?

247
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,683
Mannix?

248
00:13:50,024 --> 00:13:51,461
The Man from U.N.C.L.E.?

249
00:13:51,794 --> 00:13:53,365
The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.?

250
00:13:54,323 --> 00:13:57,752
How about Batman and Robin?
Ping! Pow!

251
00:13:57,994 --> 00:14:00,010
Chum! Zoom!

252
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:03,212
Down goes you.

253
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,196
Down goes your career
as a leading man.

254
00:14:08,577 --> 00:14:11,498
Or do you go to Rome

255
00:14:11,847 --> 00:14:13,649
and star in Westerns?

256
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,004
And win fucking fights.

257
00:14:29,622 --> 00:14:30,519
Muchas gracias.

258
00:14:33,435 --> 00:14:35,157
All right, what the
matter, partner?

259
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,490
It's official, old buddy.

260
00:14:39,664 --> 00:14:41,236
I'm a has-been.

261
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:43,912
What are you talkin' about?
What'd that guy tell you?

262
00:14:43,937 --> 00:14:45,869
Told me the goddamn
truth is what he told me.

263
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:50,335
Whoa, whoa.

264
00:14:50,969 --> 00:14:51,969
Hey.

265
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:53,517
I'm sorry 'bout that.
Sorry 'bout that.

266
00:14:53,596 --> 00:14:54,845
Here, put these on.

267
00:14:55,904 --> 00:14:57,444
Don't cry in front
of the Mexicans.

268
00:14:58,113 --> 00:15:00,018
What's gotten you so upset, man?

269
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,273
Well, if coming
face to face with the

270
00:15:02,353 --> 00:15:04,709
failure that is your career
ain't worth cryin' about,

271
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:06,424
then I don't know
what the fuck is.

272
00:15:06,813 --> 00:15:08,541
Why? That guy in there
turn you down?

273
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:09,592
No.

274
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,927
He wants to help me
get into Italian movies.

275
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,613
Well, then, what's the problem?

276
00:15:13,677 --> 00:15:15,604
I gotta do fuckin' Italian
goddamn movies!

277
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:16,994
That's the fuckin' problem.

278
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,702
Fuck this bullshit!

279
00:15:19,388 --> 00:15:20,858
Don't matter whether
I cry in public

280
00:15:20,898 --> 00:15:22,628
nobody remembers
so fuck that, anyway.

281
00:15:26,244 --> 00:15:27,252
Fuck!

282
00:15:28,015 --> 00:15:29,403
- Fuck!
- Hey.

283
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:30,809
Hey, let's go.

284
00:15:31,224 --> 00:15:32,383

Ten years of-of...
treading water.

306
00:16:51,442 --> 00:16:53,735
Now, race to the bottom.

307
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:57,958
Look, I never had much
of a career to speak of.

308
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:00,979
So, I can't say I really
know how you feel.

309
00:17:01,295 --> 00:17:02,390
What are you talkin' 'bout?

310
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:05,081
Y-You're a stunt double.
Come on now, shit.

311
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:08,234
Rick, I'm your driver, man
I'm-I'm your gopher.

312
00:17:08,538 --> 00:17:09,872
I'm not complaining.

313
00:17:09,911 --> 00:17:11,419
Man, I like driving you around.

314
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:13,229
I like doing shit
around the house.

315
00:17:13,313 --> 00:17:16,099
Housesitting in the Hollywood
hills when you're gone.

316
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,890
But I've been a full time
stunt man for a while now and

317
00:17:21,285 --> 00:17:22,618
from where I'm standin',

318
00:17:23,064 --> 00:17:24,691
going to Rome
to star in movies

319
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,605
does not sound like the
fate worse than death

320
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,954
that you seem to think it is.

321
00:17:27,979 --> 00:17:29,448
Come on, now.
You ever seen a

322
00:17:29,473 --> 00:17:32,370

She... was engaged to him.

And she...

555
00:31:40,034 --> 00:31:43,844
flew to the UK

556
00:31:44,395 --> 00:31:46,538
to make a film with him

557
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:50,006
and broke off her
engagement with him

558
00:31:50,153 --> 00:31:51,971
and married him.

559
00:31:53,555 --> 00:31:57,197
Then they... moved to Los Angeles...

560
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:01,145

have been inseparable.

00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,566
and I could not me more
delighted that you're doing this.

637
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:05,269
Oh, thank you, Sam...
I appreciate it.

638
00:36:05,294 --> 00:36:06,428
It's a good part.

639
00:36:06,453 --> 00:36:08,864
Have you met Jim Stacy,
the series lead?

640
00:36:08,889 --> 00:36:10,877
Uh, not yet, no, no.

641
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,664
Well, you guys are gonna
be dynamite together.

642
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:17,595
Well, it sounds exciting.

643
00:36:17,643 --> 00:36:19,254
Yeah, lightning in a bottle!

644
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,588
Now, you met

645
00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:22,477
- Sonya, makeup and hair?
- Hi.

646
00:36:22,522 --> 00:36:25,986
And this is Rebecca
who does costumes.

647
00:36:26,011 --> 00:36:27,406
- Hi.
- Howdy.

648
00:36:27,449 --> 00:36:29,235
Now, I want a whole
new look for Caleb.

649
00:36:29,267 --> 00:36:31,766
I don't want this Western
costume the way they costume

650
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:34,609
The Big Valley and Bonanza
from the last decade.

651
00:36:34,727 --> 00:36:38,132
I want a zeitgeist
flair in the costumes.

652
00:36:39,335 --> 00:36:40,875
I mean, nothing anachronistic,

653
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:45,185
but when does 1869
and 1969 meet?

654
00:36:45,249 --> 00:36:48,145
Especially when it
comes to you, Caleb.

655
00:36:49,066 --> 00:36:50,947
First off, I wanna
give him a mustache.

656
00:36:51,122 --> 00:36:55,638
A big, droopy,
Zapata-like mustache.

657
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,040
Now, about his jacket...

658
00:36:58,238 --> 00:37:00,159
I wanna give him a
hippie jacket.

659
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,528
Something that he could wear
into the London Fog tonight

660
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,515
and look like the
hippest guy in the room.

661
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:06,952
Far out.
We got a Custer jacket,

662
00:37:07,033 --> 00:37:09,121
fringes all down the arm.

663
00:37:09,176 --> 00:37:11,526
It's tan now,
but I dye it dark brown,

664
00:37:11,654 --> 00:37:13,384
he could hit the
strip in it tonight.

665
00:37:13,556 --> 00:37:15,337
That's my girl.

666
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:17,312
Now, Rick, about your hair.

667
00:37:17,337 --> 00:37:18,907
W-What about my hair?

668
00:37:18,932 --> 00:37:20,591
I wanna go with a
different hairstyle.

669
00:37:20,731 --> 00:37:22,168
Oh, what?

670
00:37:22,193 --> 00:37:24,233
Something more... hippie-ish.

671
00:37:24,691 --> 00:37:27,945
Well... you want me
to look like a hippie?

672
00:37:27,988 --> 00:37:31,075
Well, think less hippie, more...

673
00:37:31,132 --> 00:37:32,631
Hell's Angel!

674
00:37:36,043 --> 00:37:38,392
Say... Sam, Sam, uh...

675
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:41,770
You got me covered up
in all this, uh...

676
00:37:41,905 --> 00:37:43,817
this... junk.

677
00:37:43,884 --> 00:37:46,321
Uh, how's the audience
gonna know it's me?

678
00:37:47,061 --> 00:37:48,426
I hope they don't.

679
00:37:48,451 --> 00:37:49,365
Hmm.

680
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:54,045
I don't want them to see
Jake Cahill.

681
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,181
I want them to see Caleb!

682
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,120
I hired you to be an actor, Rick,

683
00:37:59,889 --> 00:38:01,761
and not a TV cowboy.

684
00:38:01,896 --> 00:38:03,365
You're better than that.

00:41:37,814 --> 00:41:39,123
Hey, Randy.

728
00:41:41,293 --> 00:41:42,381
Cliff.

729
00:41:43,484 --> 00:41:45,087
So, you're still with Rick, huh?

730
00:41:45,928 --> 00:41:47,190
Still here.

731
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:49,420
He in there?

732
00:41:49,532 --> 00:41:50,928
Yeah, just knock.

733
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:58,702
Look, j-just put him
into wardrobe, all right?

734
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:01,786
What's it gonna hurt? Then if you
need him, you got him, right?

735
00:42:01,876 --> 00:42:05,551
Then I gotta have a conversation
with that wardrobe assistant,

736
00:42:05,576 --> 00:42:07,750
and man, she's a fuckin' bitch,
I just don't...

737
00:42:07,797 --> 00:42:10,846
Look, look, Randy, I'm askin'
you to help me out, man.

738
00:42:10,871 --> 00:42:14,546
If the answer's no, the answer's no.
Not-Not no with excuses.

739
00:42:15,252 --> 00:42:16,617
Hey, man.

740
00:42:17,649 --> 00:42:20,862
This ain't a fuckin'
Andy McLaglen picture, you know.

741
00:42:21,012 --> 00:42:23,726
And I can't afford to hire a
bunch of guys to smoke cigarettes

742
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:25,571
and sit around talkin'
to each other all day

743
00:42:25,596 --> 00:42:27,468
on the chance
that I might use 'em.

744
00:42:27,581 --> 00:42:29,454
I got a four man team here, Rick.

745
00:42:29,521 --> 00:42:31,655
I need more than that,
I gotta get it approved.

746
00:42:31,759 --> 00:42:33,941
And you know,
I-I gotta look after my dudes.

747
00:42:34,008 --> 00:42:37,762
Hey, a-and if your dudes were
a better match for me,

748
00:42:37,787 --> 00:42:39,365
I'd say, o-okay,
you got me, b-b-but

749
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,684
but th-that's not the case
and you know it.

750
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:42,819
He's a great fuckin'
match for me.

751
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:43,851
Yeah, yeah, I know.

752
00:42:43,876 --> 00:42:45,860
Hey, you could do
anything you want to him.

753
00:42:45,919 --> 00:42:48,136
Shit, th-throw him
off a building, right?

754
00:42:48,176 --> 00:42:50,977
Light him on fire, hit him
with a fucking Lincoln, right?

755
00:42:51,012 --> 00:42:52,813
Get creative,
do whatever you want.

756
00:42:52,838 --> 00:42:54,415
He's just happy
for the opportunity.

757
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,345
Rick.

758
00:42:55,377 --> 00:42:56,369
Yeah.

759
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:00,258
I don't dig him.

760
00:43:02,298 --> 00:43:04,845
And I don't dig the
vibe he brings on set.

761
00:43:06,137 --> 00:43:08,548
What, is there some old
beef between you two?

762
00:43:08,573 --> 00:43:09,811
Come on, man.

763
00:43:09,901 --> 00:43:10,821
What?

764
00:43:11,281 --> 00:43:13,551
The dude killed his fuckin' wife.

765
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:16,217
Oh... come on, man.

766
00:43:16,265 --> 00:43:18,480
You don't believe
that old shit, do you?

767
00:43:18,505 --> 00:43:20,179
Yes, Rick, I do.

768
00:43:20,455 --> 00:43:23,161
And I work with my wife
and she believes it.

769
00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:25,855
She didn't want his
creepy ass around.

770
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:31,686
You know, this is probably
the shittiest weather ever.

771
00:43:31,797 --> 00:43:35,118
The shittiest weather
on the shittiest boat

772
00:43:35,142 --> 00:43:37,420
with the shittiest person.

773
00:43:38,656 --> 00:43:41,037
Natalie, my sister, said,
"He's a loser."

774
00:43:41,062 --> 00:43:42,099
"He's a loser."

775
00:43:42,131 --> 00:43:44,052
They all said it,
"He's a fuckin' loser",

776
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:45,447
and I didn't believe them.

777
00:43:45,472 --> 00:43:47,472
So, I guess I'm
the fuckin' idiot.

778
00:43:48,663 --> 00:43:50,219
And now you're
not gonna talk to me?

779
00:43:50,322 --> 00:43:52,354
What, you don't
feel like fighting?

780
00:43:52,723 --> 00:43:54,580
Well, I feel like fucking fight.

781
00:43:54,605 --> 00:43:57,715
And I've been up here
by myself for four hours

782
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:00,217
on this fucking
shithole of a boat...

783
00:44:00,818 --> 00:44:01,977
Yeah.

784
00:44:04,687 --> 00:44:06,838
He's a goddamn war hero.

785
00:44:15,629 --> 00:44:17,605
Okay, you fuckin' horse's ass.

786
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:19,740
Let's get you over to wardrobe.

787
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,884
Now, I'll put you in wardrobe,

788
00:44:25,241 --> 00:44:27,447
but you don't stunt,
I don't pay you.

789
00:44:27,683 --> 00:44:30,389
Appreciate the opportunity,
Randy. I won't let you down.

790
00:44:30,706 --> 00:44:33,032
You know my wife,
Janet, don't you?

791
00:44:33,664 --> 00:44:34,783
Yeah.

792
00:44:35,029 --> 00:44:36,521
Steer clear of her.

793
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:40,407
Now, I admire Cassius Clay, I do.

794
00:44:40,554 --> 00:44:42,029
What I admire is

795
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:45,205
in his sport, there's
an element of true combat.

796
00:44:45,494 --> 00:44:48,034
When Cassius Clay meets
Sonny Liston in the ring,

797
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:50,186
that's not two
athletes posturing.

798
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:51,999
That's combat.

799
00:44:52,382 --> 00:44:55,286
Two men trying to kill
each other right now.

800
00:44:55,672 --> 00:44:57,378
If you don't beat him,

801
00:44:58,036 --> 00:44:59,354
he kills you.

802
00:44:59,977 --> 00:45:01,644
That's beyond athletics.

803
00:45:01,744 --> 00:45:05,069
That's beyond Wide World of
Sports, you know?

804
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:07,398
That's two warriors
engaged in combat.

805
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,327
That's what I admire.

806
00:45:09,972 --> 00:45:11,552
In martial arts tournaments,

807
00:45:11,782 --> 00:45:14,980
they won't let you fight like that.
It's very frustrating.

808
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,849
You stand in front of a guy,

809
00:45:16,874 --> 00:45:18,461
you just wanna let him have it.

810
00:45:19,769 --> 00:45:21,245
But you can't.

811
00:45:21,404 --> 00:45:24,967
So you gotta do this
play-acting, pattycake version.

812
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,348
Cassius Clay,
Sonny Liston, Joe Lewis.

813
00:45:28,662 --> 00:45:31,686
The colored boxer,
not that white kickboxing asshole.

814
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,738
They do what they
need to do to win.

815
00:45:35,917 --> 00:45:38,498
They unleash as much
punishment as they have to

816
00:45:38,523 --> 00:45:40,642
to defeat the other guy.

817
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:42,699
But in martial arts tournaments,

818
00:45:42,802 --> 00:45:45,254
I do to win what
they do to win.

819
00:45:45,622 --> 00:45:48,226
I unleash all my power.

820
00:45:49,302 --> 00:45:50,461
I kill people.

821
00:45:50,852 --> 00:45:53,003
Well, if you fought
Cassius Clay, who would win?

822
00:45:53,197 --> 00:45:56,065
Well, that would never happen.

823
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,216
But if you did, what do
you think would happen?

824
00:45:59,867 --> 00:46:01,525
I'd make him a cripple.

825
00:46:04,332 --> 00:46:05,650
Hey, you.

826
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:07,225
What's your name?

827
00:46:07,337 --> 00:46:09,377
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

828
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,468
My name's Cliff.

829
00:46:12,745 --> 00:46:14,873
I'm Rick Dalton's stunt double.

830
00:46:14,966 --> 00:46:16,101
Stuntman?

831
00:46:16,434 --> 00:46:17,545
Yeah.

832
00:46:17,666 --> 00:46:19,841
You know, you're kind of
pretty for a stuntman.

833
00:46:20,151 --> 00:46:21,856
That's what they tell me.

834
00:46:22,075 --> 00:46:25,710
So, did I say
something funny, stuntman?

835
00:46:26,226 --> 00:46:29,067
- Yeah, you kinda did.
- What's so funny?

836
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:31,270
Look, man,
I don't want any trouble.

837
00:46:31,365 --> 00:46:32,945
I'm just here to do a job.

838
00:46:33,171 --> 00:46:34,933
But you're laughing at
what I'm saying,

839
00:46:34,967 --> 00:46:36,562
but I'm not saying
anything funny.

840
00:46:36,609 --> 00:46:38,601
So, what do you
think is so funny?

841
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:41,944
What I think is...

842
00:46:44,341 --> 00:46:47,299
you're a little man with a
big mouth and a big chip.

843
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,981
And I think you
should be embarrassed

844
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,672
to suggest that you'd
be anything more

845
00:46:50,697 --> 00:46:53,721
than a stain on the seat of
Cassius Clay's trunks.

846
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,123
Brother...

847
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:57,083
you're the one
with the big mouth.

848
00:46:57,276 --> 00:46:58,887
And I would really
enjoy closing it

849
00:46:58,912 --> 00:47:01,110
especially in front
of all my friends.

850
00:47:01,963 --> 00:47:05,058
But my hands are registered
as lethal weapons.

851
00:47:05,419 --> 00:47:06,745
That means...

852
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,554
we get into a fight,
I accidentally kill you,

853
00:47:09,837 --> 00:47:11,258
I go to jail.

854
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:15,089
Anybody accidentally kills
anybody in a fight, they go to jail.

855
00:47:15,114 --> 00:47:16,551
It's called manslaughter.

856
00:47:16,831 --> 00:47:19,258
I think all that lethal weapon
horseshit is just an excuse

857
00:47:19,283 --> 00:47:22,118
so you dancers never have
to get in a real fight.

858
00:47:23,767 --> 00:47:24,886
Okay.

859
00:47:25,823 --> 00:47:27,537
How about a friendly contest?

860
00:47:28,932 --> 00:47:32,027
No punching in the face,
two out of three.

861
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,554
Who puts who
on the ground first.

862
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,300
Nobody tries to hurt
nobody, just...

863
00:47:37,459 --> 00:47:39,252
who ends up on their butt.

864
00:47:43,591 --> 00:47:45,583
That's a great idea, Kato.

865
00:47:57,806 --> 00:47:59,608
You know, Bruce,
that guy's kinda famous.

866
00:47:59,664 --> 00:48:00,933
That guy?

867
00:48:01,164 --> 00:48:02,592
For what?

868
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,933
Killed his wife and
got away with it.

869
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:06,703
That guy?

870
00:48:07,071 --> 00:48:08,309
That guy.

871
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:34,333
Not bad, Kato.

872
00:48:35,475 --> 00:48:36,880
Try that again.

873
00:49:18,733 --> 00:49:19,972
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!

874
00:49:20,635 --> 00:49:23,154
What the fuck is going on here?

875
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:26,003
Hey, jackass, this is our series lead.

876
00:49:26,067 --> 00:49:27,591
The fuck are you thinking?

877
00:49:27,616 --> 00:49:29,389
You're right, Janet.
I'm sorry about that.

878
00:49:29,414 --> 00:49:32,470
Don't fucking Janet me, you prick.

879
00:49:32,523 --> 00:49:34,864
Hey! What's up, babe?

880
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,310
"What's up", Randy
is that your loser asshole

881
00:49:38,335 --> 00:49:40,264
wife-killing buddy boy here

882
00:49:40,304 --> 00:49:42,081
was beating the
shit out of Bruce!

883
00:49:42,106 --> 00:49:43,375
What?

884
00:49:43,623 --> 00:49:44,567
Hey, Randy.

885
00:49:44,592 --> 00:49:45,542
Cliff!

886
00:49:45,638 --> 00:49:47,495
What the fuck, man?

887
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:48,871
Let me just say...

888
00:49:48,954 --> 00:49:50,891
nobody beat the
shit out of Bruce.

889
00:49:51,112 --> 00:49:53,271
It was a friendly contest.
He barely touched me.

890
00:49:53,402 --> 00:49:56,441
I think that dent in the car
says somethin' different.

891
00:49:57,278 --> 00:49:59,896
Oh, my God!

892
00:49:59,921 --> 00:50:02,569
What the fuck did
you do to my car?

893
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:04,789
What the fuck did
you do to her car?

894
00:50:05,295 --> 00:50:06,731
I threw this little prick into it

895
00:50:06,756 --> 00:50:08,502
but I did not know
it was her car.

896
00:50:08,692 --> 00:50:10,295
Get the wardrobe off,

897
00:50:10,399 --> 00:50:11,986
get your shit

898
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:13,256
and get fucked!

899
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:14,425
- Janet!
- What?

900
00:50:14,464 --> 00:50:15,852
I will handle this.

901
00:50:15,893 --> 00:50:17,700
Then, fucking handle it, Randy!

902
00:50:18,843 --> 00:50:20,176
Cliff...

903
00:50:20,873 --> 00:50:22,357
get the wardrobe off,

904
00:50:22,429 --> 00:50:23,929
get your shit

905
00:50:24,246 --> 00:50:26,278
and get off the lot.

906
00:50:29,429 --> 00:50:30,802

00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:38,284
Well, Terry and Candy
don't live here anymore.

923
00:51:38,339 --> 00:51:40,450

924

I know we just broke for lunch,

940
00:52:24,816 --> 00:52:27,586
but you need to wait at least
an hour before you can eat.

941
00:52:27,706 --> 00:52:29,182
Give the glue a chance to dry.

942
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:32,250
No worries, honey.
I got my book.

943
00:52:32,395 --> 00:52:33,451
Say, say...

944
00:52:33,522 --> 00:52:35,338
Where's the bad guy saloon?

945
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,557
You just go straight
to Western town,

946
00:52:37,582 --> 00:52:39,911
take a right and a left
and you'll see it right there.

947
00:52:39,959 --> 00:52:41,173
Thanks, honey.

948
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:43,704
Hello.

949
00:53:46,715 --> 00:53:47,779
Hello.

950
00:53:50,201 --> 00:53:51,105
Hello.

951
00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:57,399
Bother you if
I sat next to you,

952
00:53:57,424 --> 00:53:59,012
and read my book, too?

953
00:54:01,149 --> 00:54:02,331
I don't know.

954
00:54:03,664 --> 00:54:05,183
Would you bother me?

955
00:54:05,899 --> 00:54:07,524
I'll try not to.

956
00:54:10,737 --> 00:54:11,952
Sit.

957
00:54:58,983 --> 00:55:00,856
Sorry. Sorry 'bout that.

958
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:09,627
You don't eat lunch?

959
00:55:10,794 --> 00:55:12,397
I've got a scene after lunch.

960
00:55:13,135 --> 00:55:14,341
Yeah?

961
00:55:15,634 --> 00:55:18,864
Eating lunch before I do
a scene makes me sluggish.

962
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:21,000
I believe it's the
job of an actor,

963
00:55:21,025 --> 00:55:23,271
and I say actor not actress

964
00:55:23,296 --> 00:55:26,071
because the word
actress is nonsensical.

965
00:55:26,135 --> 00:55:27,920
It's the actor's job

966
00:55:27,945 --> 00:55:30,655
to avoid impediments
to their performance.

967
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:32,189
It's the actor's job

968
00:55:32,214 --> 00:55:35,024
to strive for 100% effectiveness.

969
00:55:35,329 --> 00:55:39,908
Naturally, we never succeed,
but it's the pursuit

970
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:42,198
that's meaningful.

971
00:55:43,069 --> 00:55:44,218
Who are you?

972
00:55:44,243 --> 00:55:45,973
You can call me Mirabella.

973
00:55:46,031 --> 00:55:48,793
Mi-Mirabella what?

974
00:55:48,944 --> 00:55:50,491
Mirabella Lancer.

975
00:55:50,593 --> 00:55:54,466
No, no, c-come on,
W-What's your real name?

976
00:55:55,954 --> 00:55:57,160
When we're on set,

977
00:55:57,185 --> 00:56:00,074
I prefer to only be referred
to by my character's name.

978
00:56:00,185 --> 00:56:02,978
It helps me immerse in
the reality of the story.

979
00:56:03,434 --> 00:56:04,998
I've tried it both ways and I'm

980
00:56:05,037 --> 00:56:08,005
always just a tiny bit better
when I don't break character.

981
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:10,118
If I can be a tiny bit better...

982
00:56:10,511 --> 00:56:12,170
I want to be.

983
00:56:14,866 --> 00:56:17,977
You're the bad guy.
Caleb DeCoteau.

984
00:56:21,603 --> 00:56:25,301
Thought it was
pronounced Caleb DeCoteau.

985
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,948
I'm pretty sure it's DeCoteau.

986
00:56:30,339 --> 00:56:32,752
- DeCoteau.
- Mm-hmm.

987
00:56:33,638 --> 00:56:36,051
DeCoteau. DeCoteau.

988
00:56:54,233 --> 00:56:55,852
What are you reading?

989
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,361
It's a biography on Walt Disney.

990
00:56:59,675 --> 00:57:01,230
It's fascinating.

991
00:57:01,255 --> 00:57:03,128
He's a genius, you know.

992
00:57:03,243 --> 00:57:06,172
I mean, once in every 50
or 100 years kind of genius.

993
00:57:06,346 --> 00:57:08,569
Wh-What are you, twelve?

994
00:57:09,675 --> 00:57:11,024
I'm eight.

995
00:57:11,794 --> 00:57:13,390
What are you reading?

996
00:57:14,953 --> 00:57:16,389
Just a Western.

997
00:57:16,437 --> 00:57:19,111
What does that mean?
Is it good?

998
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,746
Pretty good.

999
00:57:21,226 --> 00:57:22,869
What's the story?

1000
00:57:23,787 --> 00:57:25,613
Haven't finished it yet.

1001
00:57:25,795 --> 00:57:28,883
I didn't ask for the whole story.

1002
00:57:28,935 --> 00:57:31,237
What's the idea of the story?

1003
00:57:32,004 --> 00:57:37,433
Well... it's about, uh, this guy
who's a bronco buster.

1004
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:40,556
It's a story of his life.

1005
00:57:41,417 --> 00:57:43,179
The guy's name is Tom Breezy

1006
00:57:43,204 --> 00:57:45,807
but everyone always
calls him Easy Breezy.

1007
00:57:46,216 --> 00:57:50,439
Now, when Easy Breezy
was in his 20s and-and

1008
00:57:50,486 --> 00:57:52,586
young and good-lookin', he could

1009
00:57:52,611 --> 00:57:55,175
he could break any horse
that you can throw at him.

1010
00:57:55,453 --> 00:57:58,009
Back then, he just had a way.

1011
00:57:58,543 --> 00:58:00,829
Now, he's into his, uh,

1012
00:58:01,022 --> 00:58:04,668
late 30s and takes a bad fall
and messes up his hip

1013
00:58:04,716 --> 00:58:08,748
He's not... crippled
or anything like that, but...

1014
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,731
but he's got spine problems

1015
00:58:12,103 --> 00:58:14,873
he's never had before
and he spends, uh,

1016
00:58:16,069 --> 00:58:19,798
more of his days in pain than
he ever did before.

1017
00:58:19,891 --> 00:58:22,391
Jeepers, it sounds like a good novel.

1018
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:25,119
Yeah, it's not bad.

1019
00:58:26,556 --> 00:58:28,127
Where are you in it?

1020
00:58:29,015 --> 00:58:30,595
About midway.

1021
00:58:32,151 --> 00:58:34,564
What's happening
to Easy Breezy now?

1022
00:58:35,331 --> 00:58:37,513
Uh, he's, uh...

1023
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:40,736
He's not the best anymore.

1024
00:58:42,137 --> 00:58:44,097
In fact, far from it.

1025
00:58:46,076 --> 00:58:49,404
He's comin' to terms of what
it's like to be slightly more...

1026
00:58:52,735 --> 00:58:54,042
use...

1027
00:59:02,046 --> 00:59:03,752
Slightly more useless

1028
00:59:04,464 --> 00:59:05,868
each day.

1029
00:59:21,717 --> 00:59:23,503
I-It's okay, Caleb.

1030
00:59:23,614 --> 00:59:25,122
It's okay.

1031
00:59:25,515 --> 00:59:27,515
Sounds like a really sad book.

1032
00:59:27,936 --> 00:59:29,666
Poor Easy Breezy.

1033
00:59:30,011 --> 00:59:33,249
I'm practically cryin'
and I haven't even read it.

1034
00:59:34,502 --> 00:59:36,764
About 15 years,
you'll be livin' it.

1035
00:59:36,946 --> 00:59:38,160
What?

1036
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:42,923
Nothin' pumpkinpuss.

1037
00:59:43,344 --> 00:59:44,431
I'm just...

1038
00:59:45,137 --> 00:59:46,423
I'm just teasin' ya.

1039
00:59:47,894 --> 00:59:49,814
You know somethin', you, uh...

1040
00:59:50,925 --> 00:59:53,108
you might be right
about this book.

1041
00:59:53,984 --> 00:59:56,770
I think it hits harder
than I gave it credit for.

1042
00:59:58,974 --> 01:00:02,292
I don't like names
like "pumpkinpuss"...

1043
01:00:03,157 --> 01:00:04,911
but since you're upset...

1044
01:00:05,265 --> 01:00:07,566
we'll talk about that
some other time.

Thanks so much.

1058
01:01:30,807 --> 01:01:32,410
- Well, good luck on your adventure.
- Thank you.

1059
01:01:32,545 --> 01:01:34,767
- Have a good time at Big Sur.
- Thank you so much.

1060
01:01:34,807 --> 01:01:35,783
Take care.

1061
01:02:42,659 --> 01:02:43,881
Oh, hey.

1062
01:02:44,238 --> 01:02:45,340
Hello.

1063
01:02:45,365 --> 01:02:47,691
How can I help you, young lady?

1064
01:02:50,339 --> 01:02:52,155
I'm here to pick
up a first edition

1065
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:54,609
of Thomas Hardy's
<i>Tess of the d'Urbervilles</i> I ordered.

1066
01:02:54,736 --> 01:02:56,077
It's under Polanski.

1067
01:02:56,104 --> 01:02:57,785
Yeah, you're talking
books here, kid.

1068
01:02:57,810 --> 01:02:59,881
Oh, I know. Isn't it wonderful?

1069
01:02:59,957 --> 01:03:01,623
- I just read it.
- Yeah?

1070
01:03:01,648 --> 01:03:03,718
I'm getting it as a
gift for my husband.

1071
01:03:06,714 --> 01:03:09,039
- Rick Dalton?
- You bet.

1072
01:03:09,086 --> 01:03:10,419
Jim Stacy.

1073
01:03:10,444 --> 01:03:12,097
It's my show. Welcome aboard.

1074
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:15,108
We're real glad to have a pro like
you playing the heavy on the pilot.

1075
01:03:15,319 --> 01:03:16,692
And I gotta tell ya...

1076
01:03:16,722 --> 01:03:20,278
I came damn close to being
in The 14 Fists of McCluskey.

1077
01:03:20,527 --> 01:03:22,305
- No kiddin'?
- Yeah!

1078
01:03:23,618 --> 01:03:25,975
I just got my part for sheer luck.

1079
01:03:26,074 --> 01:03:29,471
Up until two weeks before
shootin', Fabian was in the part,

1080
01:03:29,586 --> 01:03:32,333
Th-Then he breaks his
shoulder doing The Virginian,

1081
01:03:32,358 --> 01:03:33,556
that's how I got it, so.

1082
01:03:33,581 --> 01:03:34,738
Ah!

1083
01:03:36,168 --> 01:03:39,216
Hey, Rick, I gotta ask you
somethin' I heard about.

1084
01:03:40,017 --> 01:03:42,779
Was it true you almost got the
McQueen part in The Great Escape?

1085
01:03:44,634 --> 01:03:45,744
Hilts, isn't it?

1086
01:03:45,769 --> 01:03:47,544
Captain Hilts, actually.

1087
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:51,553
But, the story goes,
for a brief moment,

1088
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:54,927
McQueen almost
passed on the movie

1089
01:03:54,952 --> 01:03:58,151
and in that brief moment,
I-I was on a list of four.

1090
01:03:58,234 --> 01:03:59,853
You have other plans?

1091
01:03:59,967 --> 01:04:02,879
I haven't seen Berlin yet from
the ground or from the air

1092
01:04:02,904 --> 01:04:05,150
and I plan on doing both
before the war's over.

1093
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:06,292
You and who?

1094
01:04:06,345 --> 01:04:08,289
Me... and the three Georges.

1095
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:09,694
Which three Georges?

1096
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:11,473
Peppard, Maharis, and Chakiris.

1097
01:04:11,498 --> 01:04:12,922
- Oh, man!
- Yeah.

1098
01:04:12,947 --> 01:04:14,243
That's gotta hurt.

1099
01:04:14,268 --> 01:04:16,346
Yeah, well, I didn't get it.

1100
01:04:16,743 --> 01:04:17,942
McQueen did it.

1101
01:04:17,967 --> 01:04:20,721
And frankly,
I never had a chance.

1102
01:04:22,371 --> 01:04:24,268
Ten days isolation, Hilts.

1103
01:04:24,776 --> 01:04:26,157
Captain Hilts.

1104
01:04:26,341 --> 01:04:27,778
20 days.

1105
01:04:27,966 --> 01:04:29,093
Right.

1106
01:04:30,221 --> 01:04:32,943
Oh, uh, you'll still be here
when I get out?

1107
01:04:34,478 --> 01:04:35,788
Cooler.

1108
01:05:31,178 --> 01:05:32,218
One, please.

1109
01:05:32,486 --> 01:05:34,033
75 cents.

1110
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,372
What if I'm in the movie?

1111
01:05:39,932 --> 01:05:41,154
What do you mean?

1112
01:05:41,273 --> 01:05:43,503
I mean, I'm in the movie.

1113
01:05:43,789 --> 01:05:45,337
I'm Sharon Tate.

1114
01:05:46,271 --> 01:05:47,255
You're in this?

1115
01:05:47,319 --> 01:05:50,406
Mm-hmm. I play Miss Carlson.
The klutz.

1116
01:05:51,459 --> 01:05:52,856
That's me.

1117
01:05:54,233 --> 01:05:56,876
But that's the girl from
Valley of the Dolls.

1118
01:05:58,458 --> 01:06:00,322
Well, that's me,

1119
01:06:00,347 --> 01:06:02,784
the girl from Valley of the Dolls.

1120
01:06:03,717 --> 01:06:05,979
- Really?
- Really.

1121
01:06:08,426 --> 01:06:10,441
Hey, Ruben! Come out here.

1122
01:06:13,671 --> 01:06:15,750
This is the girl from
Valley of the Dolls.

1123
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:19,063
- Patty Duke?
- No, the other one.

1124
01:06:19,088 --> 01:06:21,133
- The girl from Peyton Place?
- No, the other one.

1125
01:06:21,205 --> 01:06:23,617
The one who ends up
doing dirty movies.

1126
01:06:24,012 --> 01:06:25,242
Oh...

1127
01:06:25,424 --> 01:06:26,407
She's in this movie.

1128
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,264
Oh.

1129
01:06:27,345 --> 01:06:28,512
Sharon Tate.

1130
01:06:28,664 --> 01:06:29,846
Well...

1131
01:06:29,871 --> 01:06:32,056
Welcome to the Bruin, Miss Tate.

1132
01:06:32,081 --> 01:06:33,710
Thank you for coming
to our theater.

1133
01:06:33,896 --> 01:06:35,466
Would you like to come
in and see the show?

1134
01:06:35,497 --> 01:06:36,528
Could I?

1135
01:06:36,586 --> 01:06:37,697
By all means.

1136
01:06:39,046 --> 01:06:40,118
Thank you.

1137
01:06:41,996 --> 01:06:44,052
Hey... can I get a picture?

1138
01:06:44,115 --> 01:06:45,353
Oh, sure!

1139
01:06:50,024 --> 01:06:52,111
You know, why don't you
stand over by the poster?

1140
01:06:52,144 --> 01:06:53,953
So people will
know who you are.

1141
01:06:54,476 --> 01:06:55,564
Okay.

1142
01:06:56,196 --> 01:06:57,164
Could you?

1143
01:07:09,667 --> 01:07:11,088
Would you like
some refreshments?

1144
01:07:11,137 --> 01:07:13,473
- No, I'm fine, thank you.
- Enjoy the show.

<i>Oh!</i>

1166

<i>I'm Freya.</i>

1167
01:08:35,316 --> 01:08:37,633
<i>Welcome to Denmark, Mr. Helm.</i>

1168
01:08:38,358 --> 01:08:40,858
<i>These are for you.
Street maps, places of interest.</i>

1169
01:08:41,728 --> 01:08:42,982
<i>This is for you, too.</i>

1170

<i>- Oh, what year was that?
- 1949.</i>

1171
01:08:46,686 --> 01:08:48,146
<i>Oh, it's a very good year.</i>

1172
01:08:48,201 --> 01:08:50,146
<i>I'm here to help you
in any way I can.</i>

1173
01:08:50,205 --> 01:08:51,640
<i>Well, that's very nice of you.</i>

1174
01:08:51,665 --> 01:08:53,141
<i>Is there anything you'd
like for me to do?</i>

1175
01:08:53,189 --> 01:08:54,792
<i>Yes, ma'am,
a couple of things.</i>

1176
01:08:54,895 --> 01:08:55,824
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

1177
01:08:55,895 --> 01:08:58,594
<i>Would you mind gettin'
off my camera case, please?</i>

1178
01:08:59,262 --> 01:09:01,215
<i>- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, that's fine.</i>

1179
01:09:01,754 --> 01:09:02,913
<i>That's okay.</i>

1180
01:09:03,008 --> 01:09:04,452
<i>I'm sorry about...</i>

1181
01:09:05,476 --> 01:09:07,008
<i>Welcome to Denmark.</i>

1182
01:09:15,998 --> 01:09:18,682
<i>Some kind of hotel
you got here.</i>

1183
01:09:20,988 --> 01:09:22,877
<i>Half a bottle's
better than none.</i>

1184
01:10:10,996 --> 01:10:12,859
That's far enough, jughead.

1185
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:15,746
Name's not jughead.

1186
01:10:16,741 --> 01:10:18,638
What you doin' 'round here, boy?

1187
01:10:18,912 --> 01:10:20,124
I'm thirsty.

1188
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:21,783
That's a saloon, ain't it?

1189
01:10:22,015 --> 01:10:23,301
Oh, yeah.

1190
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:24,782
That's a saloon.

1191
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,540
Only you can't come in.

1192
01:10:26,565 --> 01:10:27,993
Mr. Gilbert.

1193
01:10:29,605 --> 01:10:32,935
Don't let me stop you
from earnin' your money.

1194
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:38,280
I know how bored and restless
you get when you run out of...

1195
01:10:38,336 --> 01:10:39,684
tamales.

1196
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:43,547
But Mr. Gilbert, if I was you...

1197
01:10:44,837 --> 01:10:47,115
you'd find out that
jughead's name.

1198
01:10:48,691 --> 01:10:51,294
Allow me to introduce
the two of ya.

1199
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:55,392
This here is Bob Gilbert.

1200
01:10:56,591 --> 01:10:58,083
The businessman?

1201
01:10:58,288 --> 01:10:59,534
That's right.

1202
01:10:59,931 --> 01:11:01,883
Business Bob Gilbert.

1203
01:11:02,754 --> 01:11:04,357
Who might he be, Caleb?

1204
01:11:04,587 --> 01:11:07,111
Oh, that's a fella
by the name of Madrid.

1205
01:11:08,362 --> 01:11:09,743
Johnny Madrid.

1206
01:11:10,825 --> 01:11:13,119
Who's Johnny Madrid?

1207
01:11:18,977 --> 01:11:20,874
He ain't from 'round here.

1208
01:11:21,032 --> 01:11:22,501
No, really.

1209
01:11:23,056 --> 01:11:24,429
Who is he, Caleb?

1210
01:11:28,886 --> 01:11:30,481
Well, you're about to find out.

1211
01:11:32,352 --> 01:11:33,749
Businessman.

1212
01:11:51,055 --> 01:11:52,942
Ready when you are,

1213
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:54,237
Gilbert.

1214
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,610
Again, mas?

1215
01:12:36,139 --> 01:12:37,774
Johnny Madrid.

1216
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:44,875
How long's it been?

1217
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,383
Since that time in Juarez, 'bout...

1218
01:12:47,558 --> 01:12:48,923
three years ago.

1219
01:12:49,274 --> 01:12:51,163
Come on in, have a drink.

1220
01:12:52,094 --> 01:12:54,713
Hell, in that case...

1221
01:12:56,483 --> 01:12:57,959
buy you a drink, Caleb?

1222
01:12:59,128 --> 01:13:00,564
Sure, Johnny.

1223
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:03,819
How 'bout some mezcal?

1224
01:13:04,124 --> 01:13:06,259
Like that time in Juarez.

1225
01:13:07,811 --> 01:13:09,557
People died that day.

1226
01:13:10,581 --> 01:13:11,883
Yes, they did.

1227
01:13:13,261 --> 01:13:14,976
But we had a good time.

1228
01:13:15,753 --> 01:13:16,816
Didn't we?

1229
01:13:16,841 --> 01:13:17,944
Yeah.

1230
01:13:18,023 --> 01:13:19,174
We did.

1231
01:13:20,089 --> 01:13:21,954
After you, DeCoteau.

1232
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:24,307
Pepe!

1233
01:13:24,521 --> 01:13:27,544
Get your behind behind that
bar, I have a guest.

1234
01:13:36,087 --> 01:13:37,301
Dos mezcal.

1235
01:13:41,021 --> 01:13:42,108
<i>You have food?</i>

1236
01:13:42,571 --> 01:13:44,103
<i>Beans and tortillas.</i>

1237
01:13:44,166 --> 01:13:45,420
How's some beans?

1238
01:13:46,988 --> 01:13:48,170
I've had worse.

1239
01:13:48,498 --> 01:13:50,553
<i>Give us a plate of beans.</i>

1240
01:13:50,918 --> 01:13:52,157
One dollar.

1241
01:13:55,609 --> 01:13:58,331
To my wife
and all my sweethearts...

1242
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,276
may they never meet.

1243
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:10,031
Señor Madrid.

1244
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:11,873
Would you care to
join me at my table

1245
01:14:11,898 --> 01:14:13,410
where I entertain my guests?

1246
01:14:13,435 --> 01:14:15,602
I'd be delighted,
Monsieur DeCoteau.

1247
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:19,262
Take the bottle wit' ya.

1248
01:14:21,441 --> 01:14:22,814
So Johnny.

1249
01:14:25,511 --> 01:14:27,377
What brings you
to Royal Del Hole?

1250
01:14:27,408 --> 01:14:29,296
Oh, you know me, Caleb.

1251
01:14:30,106 --> 01:14:31,193
The money.

1252
01:14:33,002 --> 01:14:34,645
And who's paying around here?

1253
01:14:35,164 --> 01:14:36,354
I hope you.

1254
01:14:38,846 --> 01:14:40,686
And what have you
heard about me?

1255
01:14:41,356 --> 01:14:43,142
I heard about
the Lancer Ranch,

1256
01:14:43,323 --> 01:14:45,156
all the cattle
you've appropriated.

1257
01:14:45,515 --> 01:14:47,627
A lotta land, lotta
cows, a lotta money,

1258
01:14:47,652 --> 01:14:48,793
no law to speak of,

1259
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:50,264
and nothin' but an
old man and some

1260
01:14:50,289 --> 01:14:52,558
Mexican ranch hands
to shoo ya off.

1261
01:14:55,606 --> 01:14:56,567
Hey...

1262
01:14:56,744 --> 01:14:59,870
where's that chili pepper
daughter of yours' fiddle?

1263
01:15:00,617 --> 01:15:01,792
She's asleep.

1264
01:15:02,121 --> 01:15:03,882
Wake her the heck up,
get her down here

1265
01:15:03,931 --> 01:15:07,526
with her fiddle and her bow
and entertain my guest.

1266
01:15:08,271 --> 01:15:09,326
Si, señor.

1267
01:15:10,765 --> 01:15:13,225
But please,
don't hurt her this time.

1268
01:15:14,689 --> 01:15:16,332
I ain't gonna hurt her.

1269
01:15:17,015 --> 01:15:19,420
I just want her to play the fiddle.

1270
01:15:23,451 --> 01:15:24,403
Line?

1271
01:15:24,428 --> 01:15:26,474
Go... go fetch her and tell her what?

1272
01:15:26,499 --> 01:15:28,586
Go fetch her and tell
her I'll give her

1273
01:15:28,611 --> 01:15:30,198
a fat five-dollar gold piece...

1274
01:15:30,223 --> 01:15:31,874
Right, right, go fetch her
and tell her I'll give her a fat

1275
01:15:31,899 --> 01:15:33,874
fat five-
fat five-dollar gold piece

1276
01:15:33,899 --> 01:15:36,055
if she played her little chili
pepper heart out, right?

1277
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,039
- Right.
- Yeah.

1278
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:45,016
I ain't gonna hurt her.

1279
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,667
I just want her
to play the fiddle.

1280
01:15:47,859 --> 01:15:49,081
Now, go fetch her and tell her

1281
01:15:49,138 --> 01:15:51,224
I'll give her a fat
five-dollar gold piece

1282
01:15:51,249 --> 01:15:53,608
if she played her little
chili pepper heart out.

1283
01:15:54,325 --> 01:15:55,389
Go on!

1284
01:16:00,413 --> 01:16:02,183
So, Johnny.

1285
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:05,825
What else you heard, hmm?

1286
01:16:06,535 --> 01:16:08,726
I heard you're pushing
Lancer pretty hard

1287
01:16:09,027 --> 01:16:11,914
but Lancer's got money.

1288
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:14,642
At some point,

1289
01:16:15,122 --> 01:16:17,273
he's gonna hire some guns

1290
01:16:17,564 --> 01:16:19,635
and push back.

1291
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:28,222
Line? Line, line, line...

1292
01:16:28,281 --> 01:16:29,503
"Maybe he already has."

1293
01:16:32,678 --> 01:16:33,726
Maybe...

1294
01:16:33,853 --> 01:16:36,155
Goddammit!
I fucked this whole thing up!

1295
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:38,224
Damn, I fucked
this whole thing up.

1296
01:16:38,297 --> 01:16:39,414
Just go back, please.

1297
01:16:39,439 --> 01:16:40,754
Could we just cut?
Could we just cut?

1298
01:16:40,826 --> 01:16:43,794
- No, really, just say the fucking line!
- No, Sam, please.

1299
01:16:43,839 --> 01:16:46,224
"Maybe he already has"
"Maybe he already has"

1300
01:16:46,274 --> 01:16:48,766
Argh! Goddammit!
Alright! Alright! Alright!

1301
01:16:48,929 --> 01:16:50,286
Whoo!

1302
01:16:50,461 --> 01:16:52,595
Goddamn outlaw, Rick.
Come on now.

1303
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:54,181
Hoo!

1304
01:16:54,491 --> 01:16:56,443
I got it. I got it.

1305
01:16:57,193 --> 01:16:58,486
Go back a bit, would you?

1306
01:16:58,573 --> 01:17:00,407
No, he's right. Back to one.

1307
01:17:01,888 --> 01:17:04,602
- Use all that anger, use it.
- Oh, I'ma use it.

1308
01:17:04,686 --> 01:17:07,201
- You show me tough.
- Mm-hmm.

1309
01:17:09,414 --> 01:17:12,055
And... action.

1310
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:16,427
I heard you...

1311
01:17:16,712 --> 01:17:19,269
But Lancer's got money.

1312
01:17:20,119 --> 01:17:21,643
At some point,

1313
01:17:22,321 --> 01:17:24,662
he's gonna hire some guns and...

1314
01:17:25,653 --> 01:17:26,915
push back.

1315
01:17:30,072 --> 01:17:32,159
Maybe he already has.

1316
01:17:33,953 --> 01:17:34,984
Maybe.

1317
01:17:38,302 --> 01:17:39,763
Maybe I don't like Lancer.

1318
01:17:41,172 --> 01:17:43,149
Maybe I don't like his boots.

1319
01:17:44,738 --> 01:17:47,625
Maybe I don't like the
way he uses those boots

1320
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:49,222
to step on people.

1321
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:55,045
What the fuck was that?!

1322
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:57,003
Jesus Christ!

1323
01:17:57,376 --> 01:17:58,392
Fuck!

1324
01:17:59,194 --> 01:18:00,170
Shit.

1325
01:18:01,418 --> 01:18:03,069
Damn it, Rick, you screwed up

1326
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:04,888
the fucking lines!

1327
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:07,912
Embarrass yourself like that in
front of all those goddamn people!

1328
01:18:08,035 --> 01:18:09,606
You're drinkin' all night.

1329
01:18:09,671 --> 01:18:12,086
Fuckin' drinkin' again,
eight goddamn

1330
01:18:12,157 --> 01:18:13,863
fuckin' whiskey sours.

1331
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:17,546
Fuckin' bullshit.

1332
01:18:18,972 --> 01:18:21,488
You're a fuckin' miserable drunk.

1333
01:18:21,528 --> 01:18:24,020
Fuckin' remember your fuckin' lines.

1334
01:18:24,093 --> 01:18:25,489
I practiced 'em!

1335
01:18:25,514 --> 01:18:27,553
And now I don't look like
I goddamn practiced 'em!

1336
01:18:27,597 --> 01:18:29,453
You're sittin' there
like a fuckin' baboon...

1337
01:18:29,478 --> 01:18:30,243
Blah-blah-blah...

1338
01:18:30,291 --> 01:18:31,187
Duh-duh-duh...

1339
01:18:31,229 --> 01:18:32,677
Duh-duh-duh-duh. Fuck!

1340
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:33,670
Eight fuckin' whiskey sours.

1341
01:18:33,735 --> 01:18:36,553
I couldn't stop at fuckin'
three or four, I have eight?!

1342
01:18:36,608 --> 01:18:37,639
Why?

1343
01:18:37,688 --> 01:18:40,434
You're a fuckin' alcoholic,
I drink too much!

1344
01:18:40,534 --> 01:18:43,082
Every fuckin' night!
Every fuckin' night!

1345
01:18:43,129 --> 01:18:45,217
That's it, that's fuckin' it!

1346
01:18:45,302 --> 01:18:46,634
That's fuckin' it.

1347
01:18:46,659 --> 01:18:48,961
You stop drinkin' right now, alright?

1348
01:18:49,075 --> 01:18:51,353
Promise yourself you'll
stop fuckin' drinkin'.

1349
01:18:56,674 --> 01:18:57,864
Dammit!

1350
01:18:58,772 --> 01:19:00,673
You gonna show
that fucking crew.

1351
01:19:00,698 --> 01:19:02,833
You gonna show that
goddamn Jim Stacy.

1352
01:19:02,872 --> 01:19:05,117
You gonna show all them
on that goddamn fuckin' set

1353
01:19:05,189 --> 01:19:07,498
who the fuck Rick Dalton is, alright?

1354
01:19:07,539 --> 01:19:09,385
Lemme tell you somethin'...

1355
01:19:09,442 --> 01:19:11,727
you don't get these lines right...

1356
01:19:12,166 --> 01:19:14,928
I'ma blow your fuckin'
brains out tonight.

1357
01:19:15,222 --> 01:19:16,245
Alright?

1358
01:19:16,325 --> 01:19:19,944
Your brains are gonna be splattered
all over your goddamn pool.

1359
01:19:19,969 --> 01:19:21,624
I mean it, motherfucker.

1360
01:19:21,870 --> 01:19:23,497
Get your shit together.

1361
01:20:29,073 --> 01:20:30,604
- Better?
- That's great!

Hello, hotstuff.

1400
01:22:36,996 --> 01:22:38,496
Looks like third time's the charm.

1401
01:22:38,551 --> 01:22:39,622
Mmm.

1402
01:22:39,684 --> 01:22:41,231
How were those pickles?

1403
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:45,303
Real good.

1404
01:22:45,783 --> 01:22:47,339
They were the fancy kind.

1405
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:51,440
Gimme a lift?

1406
01:22:51,662 --> 01:22:52,940
Where you goin'?

1407
01:22:54,361 --> 01:22:55,734
I'm going to Chatsworth.

1408
01:22:56,559 --> 01:22:57,701
Chatsworth?

1409
01:22:58,784 --> 01:23:01,484
You hitch up and down
Burbank Boulevard all day

1410
01:23:01,571 --> 01:23:03,762
till someone says they'll
dive you to Chatsworth?

1411
01:23:04,515 --> 01:23:06,138
Tourists love to drive me.

1412
01:23:06,194 --> 01:23:08,091
I'm their favorite part of their
L.A. vacation, you know.

1413
01:23:08,123 --> 01:23:09,804
They'll be telling stories about

1414
01:23:09,829 --> 01:23:11,726
a Hollywood hippie girl

1415
01:23:11,774 --> 01:23:13,917
that took them for a ride
at the Movie Ranch

1416
01:23:13,964 --> 01:23:15,321
for the rest of their lives.

1417
01:23:15,861 --> 01:23:17,514
Wait, Spahn Movie Ranch?

1418
01:23:18,179 --> 01:23:19,275
Yeah.

1419
01:23:19,335 --> 01:23:21,264
That's where you're going,
Spahn Movie Ranch?

1420
01:23:21,359 --> 01:23:22,398
Uh-huh.

1421
01:23:22,423 --> 01:23:23,812
W-Why you goin' there?

1422
01:23:24,276 --> 01:23:25,641
I live there.

1423
01:23:25,855 --> 01:23:27,070
Alone?

1424
01:24:03,126 --> 01:24:04,222
No.

1425
01:24:04,515 --> 01:24:05,984
Me and my friends.

1426
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,956
So, you and a bunch
of friends like you

1427
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:12,020
all live at Spahn Movie Ranch?

1428
01:24:13,144 --> 01:24:14,255
Yeah.

1429
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:18,442
Well, hop in, I'll take you there.

I know where it is.

1437
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:37,312
Are you some
old cowboy guy that

1438
01:24:37,348 --> 01:24:38,467
used to make movies there?

1441
01:24:42,477 --> 01:24:45,183
Surprised how accurate that
description of me really is.

You used to...

make Westerns at the ranch
back in the old-timey days?

1445
01:24:56,612 --> 01:24:59,350
Well, if by the old-timey days

1446
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:01,446
you mean television

No, I'm not.

01:26:30,873 --> 01:26:34,370
I need to see somethin' official
to verify that you're 18

I'm not too young to fuck you.

1490
01:26:54,614 --> 01:26:56,868
But obviously,
you are too old to fuck me.

1491
01:26:57,808 --> 01:27:00,847
What I'm too old to do
is go to jail for poontang.

Yes.

It's the Boston one!

1515
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:08,277

1519
01:29:26,321 --> 01:29:27,313

1520
01:29:27,534 --> 01:29:29,789

they'd come to parlay.

1521

1522
01:29:32,642 --> 01:29:35,125
Ah, she's just fine.

01:29:40,777 --> 01:29:42,206
They haven't hurt you?

1526
01:29:42,817 --> 01:29:44,388
Not yet, I ain't.

1527
01:29:45,081 --> 01:29:46,931
But that can all change...

1528
01:29:47,859 --> 01:29:49,002
like that.

1529
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:53,692
Say...

1530
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:55,748
where'd you get that limp?

1531
01:29:57,351 --> 01:29:58,653
From the war.

1532
01:30:00,187 --> 01:30:01,171
Which side?

1533
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:04,949
I rode with the British cavalry
in India.

1534
01:30:06,733 --> 01:30:08,685
What'd they call that outfit?

1535
01:30:09,394 --> 01:30:10,902
Bengal Lancers.

1536
01:30:14,765 --> 01:30:17,241
Now, now, now, now, that is funny.
That is funny.

1537
01:30:17,305 --> 01:30:19,106
That's not so funny.

1538
01:30:19,325 --> 01:30:20,634
Don't you get it?

1539
01:30:20,746 --> 01:30:23,795
Bengal... Lancer. Hmm?

1540
01:30:24,067 --> 01:30:25,305
Oh, yeah.

1541
01:30:27,492 --> 01:30:29,579
- That is kind of funny.
- It is.

1542

is a hanging offense.

1546
01:30:42,495 --> 01:30:43,534

01:30:53,702 --> 01:30:55,797
50 thousand dollars'd buy me

1552

a whole lotta chicken
mole in Mexico.

1553

to fill you in on all the

1560
01:31:16,979 --> 01:31:21,169
the one detail I'm gonna fill
you in on right now is this...

1561
01:31:22,047 --> 01:31:25,174
I don't want no

1567
01:31:39,264 --> 01:31:41,796
You got that, Boston?!

1568

1569
01:31:43,756 --> 01:31:44,788
Yeah.

1570
01:31:45,864 --> 01:31:48,110

Oh, boy.

1577
01:32:10,245 --> 01:32:12,800
I didn't hurt you there,
Mirabella, with that throw, did I?

1578
01:32:12,858 --> 01:32:15,723
No, no, no, I'm good.
I've got pads on.

1579
01:32:15,766 --> 01:32:18,742
I always throw myself on the
floor, just for fun,

1580
01:32:18,767 --> 01:32:20,338

Rick, Rick, Rick! Put her there!

1583
01:32:26,370 --> 01:32:27,634
- Oh.
- That was it!

1584
01:32:27,733 --> 01:32:30,336
That was absolutely fantastic.
I loved it!

1585
01:32:30,561 --> 01:32:31,998
Hey, and your idea about

1586

throwing the little
girl on the ground,

1587

that just worked like a charm.

1588
01:32:35,464 --> 01:32:37,695
- You said Shakespeare.
- Oh, that's right!

1589
01:32:38,030 --> 01:32:40,470
And that's what I
mean by 'scare me'.

01:32:40,495 --> 01:32:41,200
Yeah.

1591

01:32:42,978 --> 01:32:43,697
All right.

1593
01:32:43,722 --> 01:32:45,446
Oh, and by the way...

1594
01:32:45,529 --> 01:32:47,664
"beaner bronco buster"?

1595
01:32:47,693 --> 01:32:49,200
Where the hell did
that come from?

1596
01:32:49,225 --> 01:32:50,439
Improv.

1597
01:32:50,464 --> 01:32:51,671
It's wonderful.

1598
01:32:52,205 --> 01:32:54,689
It's a triple alliterative improv.

1599
01:32:54,790 --> 01:32:56,774
Don't get those too often.

1600
01:32:56,837 --> 01:32:58,536
- Okay! We're all good!
- All right.

1601
01:32:58,599 --> 01:33:00,067
- Don't need to go again?
- No, we're done.

1602
01:33:00,092 --> 01:33:01,329
That was fantastic!

1603
01:33:01,399 --> 01:33:03,931
Okay, we're moving on.
We're in the bordello.

1604
01:33:04,068 --> 01:33:05,044
Next set up.

1605
01:33:09,058 --> 01:33:12,836
That was the best acting
I've ever seen in my whole life.

1606
01:33:14,324 --> 01:33:15,578
Thank you.

1607
01:33:33,555 --> 01:33:35,524
Rick fucking Dalton.

1608
01:33:48,464 --> 01:33:49,535
That's a car.

1609
01:33:50,975 --> 01:33:52,507
That's a strange car.

1610
01:33:53,852 --> 01:33:55,685
Snake, go see who's outside.

1611
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:09,682
So, who is it?

1612
01:34:10,146 --> 01:34:11,415
I ain't sure yet.

1613
01:34:12,259 --> 01:34:13,957
Bitchin' yellow Coupe de Ville.

1614
01:34:14,966 --> 01:34:16,347
Keep an eye on it.

1615
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:06,521
Come on.

1616
01:35:23,436 --> 01:35:24,936
Where the hell is everybody?

1617
01:35:34,601 --> 01:35:35,934
Hey, where's Gypsy?

1618
01:35:36,371 --> 01:35:37,942
She's down by the chop shop.

1619
01:35:44,626 --> 01:35:46,602
- Hey!
- Hello!

1620
01:35:46,713 --> 01:35:49,650
Gypsy, I want you to
come meet my new friend.

1621
01:35:50,376 --> 01:35:52,073
Some old lookin' dude
on a Hawaiian shirt

1622
01:35:52,098 --> 01:35:54,249
who just gave
Pussycat a ride home.

1623
01:35:54,566 --> 01:35:55,852
He just give her a lift?

1624
01:35:56,239 --> 01:35:57,176
Nope.

1625
01:35:57,485 --> 01:35:59,731
She's bringing him down the
ranch to meet everybody.

1626
01:36:00,148 --> 01:36:01,442
Stay by the door,

1627
01:36:01,467 --> 01:36:03,005
tell me if he starts
comin' this way.

1628
01:36:04,811 --> 01:36:07,168
- Welcome to our community.
- Thanks for having me.

1629
01:36:07,307 --> 01:36:09,704
And thank you for giving our
precious Pussy a ride home.

1630
01:36:09,768 --> 01:36:10,974
Think nothin' of it.

1631
01:36:11,267 --> 01:36:12,497
We love Pussy.

1632
01:36:13,090 --> 01:36:14,288
Yes, we do.

1633
01:36:14,538 --> 01:36:16,482
Where is everybody?
Where's the children?

1634
01:36:16,562 --> 01:36:18,284
Everybody left for Santa Barbara.

1635
01:36:19,147 --> 01:36:20,155
Really?

1636
01:36:20,854 --> 01:36:22,457
Charlie's gone? Everybody left?

1637
01:36:22,824 --> 01:36:25,903
Well, not everybody everybody
but mostly everybody.

1638
01:36:28,839 --> 01:36:30,014
Dag.

1639
01:36:31,109 --> 01:36:33,045
I really wanted Cliff
to meet Charlie.

1640
01:36:34,114 --> 01:36:36,225
I think Charlie's
really gonna dig ya.

1641
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:38,019
- Hey, Delilah.
- Well, maybe next time.

1642
01:36:38,727 --> 01:36:39,925
Yeah, you gotta come back.

1643
01:36:41,572 --> 01:36:43,890
- Yeah?
- Yeah, sure would.

1644
01:36:45,004 --> 01:36:47,663
How's it all comparing
to your glory days?

1645
01:36:48,112 --> 01:36:49,739
Well, things have changed.

1646
01:36:53,310 --> 01:36:55,231
Not a bad mount, Connie.

1647
01:36:55,391 --> 01:36:57,637
I used to ride horses
every day back in Tennessee.

1648
01:36:57,680 --> 01:36:59,711
- Is that right?
- Every day?

1649
01:36:59,831 --> 01:37:00,926
Well, every week.

1650
01:37:02,038 --> 01:37:02,951
All right.

1651
01:37:03,732 --> 01:37:05,034
She's a darlin'.

1652
01:37:09,325 --> 01:37:12,039
So... my name is Lulu.

1653
01:37:12,277 --> 01:37:13,563
This is Tex.

1654
01:37:13,941 --> 01:37:16,185
We're gonna be leading
you on a great trail ride

1655
01:37:16,210 --> 01:37:18,234
to the beautiful
Santa Susana canyon.

1656
01:37:19,090 --> 01:37:20,145
Now, uh...

1657
01:37:20,209 --> 01:37:22,366
Curt, I hear you're already
an experienced rider.

1658
01:37:22,391 --> 01:37:23,383
Yes.

1659
01:37:23,436 --> 01:37:25,641
- Yeah, and so are you, Connie?
- Yes, I am.

1660
01:37:25,666 --> 01:37:26,936
Tex, come here.

1661
01:37:27,051 --> 01:37:28,178
So, uh...

1662
01:37:28,249 --> 01:37:30,709
you're both experienced
riders, I guess, uh...

1663
01:37:30,734 --> 01:37:32,666
we'll just make this
ride about having fun!

1664
01:37:32,707 --> 01:37:34,118
Ready to have some fun?

1665
01:37:34,143 --> 01:37:36,818
So, uh, Pussycat brought
back some guy with her.

1666
01:37:36,958 --> 01:37:38,918
Gypsy wants you to go
give him a looksee.

1667
01:37:39,029 --> 01:37:40,513
Yeah, sure thing.

1668
01:37:59,509 --> 01:38:02,112
Oh, and here's someone
you actually have to meet.

1669
01:38:02,678 --> 01:38:05,210
One of our most favorite sons.

1670
01:38:05,274 --> 01:38:07,575
Tex, come over here
and say hi to Cliff.

1671
01:38:08,121 --> 01:38:10,025
- Howdy, Cliff.
- Tex.

1672
01:38:10,384 --> 01:38:11,907
What part of Texas you from?

1673
01:38:11,932 --> 01:38:13,630
Uh, place you never heard of.

1674
01:38:13,891 --> 01:38:15,089
Copeville.

1675
01:38:15,796 --> 01:38:17,082
Ever been to Houston?

1676
01:38:17,131 --> 01:38:18,242
'Course I have.

1677
01:38:18,369 --> 01:38:21,242
Yeah, spent two weeks once
on a Houston chain gang

1678
01:38:21,319 --> 01:38:22,883
in August, no less.

1679
01:38:22,992 --> 01:38:25,273
That don't sound
like a whole lotta fun.

1680
01:38:25,938 --> 01:38:27,764
It's the last cop's
jaw I ever broke

1681
01:38:27,789 --> 01:38:29,058
I can tell ya that.

1682
01:38:32,937 --> 01:38:33,937
Man.

1683
01:38:35,323 --> 01:38:36,823
Charlie's gonna dig you.

1684
01:38:37,782 --> 01:38:39,814
The Hawaiian guy
seems to be okay.

1685
01:38:40,125 --> 01:38:41,998
Everybody's talkin' all friendly.

1686
01:38:45,995 --> 01:38:48,194
Tex checked him out
and now he's riding away.

1687
01:38:49,073 --> 01:38:51,144
He comes this way, let me know.

1688
01:38:53,633 --> 01:38:56,514
Hey, does George Spahn
still own this ranch?

1689
01:38:56,728 --> 01:38:58,593
Yeah, George still owns it.

1690
01:38:59,065 --> 01:39:00,462
Does he still live here?

1691
01:39:00,628 --> 01:39:01,684
Yeah.

1692
01:39:01,793 --> 01:39:04,475
Does he still live...
right there?

1693
01:39:04,626 --> 01:39:05,634
Yeah.

1694
01:39:05,785 --> 01:39:07,118
Is he here now?

1695
01:39:07,654 --> 01:39:09,106
I guess so.

1696
01:39:10,722 --> 01:39:13,499
So, George gave you all
permission to be here.

1697
01:39:14,638 --> 01:39:15,749
'Course he did.

1698
01:39:15,845 --> 01:39:17,646
And you all take care of him.

1699
01:39:18,508 --> 01:39:20,048
Oh, we take care of George.

1700
01:39:20,809 --> 01:39:22,079
We love George.

1701
01:39:24,189 --> 01:39:25,840
Well, is there anything wrong

1702
01:39:25,919 --> 01:39:28,332
with me saying hello
to an old friend?

1703
01:39:28,392 --> 01:39:30,249
You can't see him right now.

1704
01:39:30,305 --> 01:39:32,313
Why can't I see him right now?

1705
01:39:33,944 --> 01:39:35,174
'Cause he's napping.

1706
01:39:37,397 --> 01:39:39,000
This is his naptime.

1707
01:39:48,896 --> 01:39:51,769
Well, I think I'll just go
see for myself.

1708
01:39:52,650 --> 01:39:54,222
You never know.

1709
01:39:54,638 --> 01:39:56,709
He mighta just woke up.

1710
01:40:06,219 --> 01:40:08,338
The Hawaiian guy's
coming this way.

1711
01:40:09,219 --> 01:40:11,068
Okay, ya'll, beat it.

1712
01:40:11,279 --> 01:40:12,533
I'll handle this guy.

You the mama bear?

1723
01:41:06,290 --> 01:41:07,515
Can I help you?

1724
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:08,859
I hope so.

1725
01:41:08,899 --> 01:41:11,971
I'm an old friend of George's,
thought I'd stop and say hello.

1726
01:41:11,996 --> 01:41:13,092
Well, that's very nice of you,

1727
01:41:13,117 --> 01:41:15,295
but unfortunately,
you picked the wrong time.

1728
01:41:15,335 --> 01:41:17,051
George is taking a nap right now.

1729
01:41:17,368 --> 01:41:19,070
Oh, that is unfortunate.

1730
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:20,895
Yes, it is.

1731
01:41:21,907 --> 01:41:23,331
What's your name?

1732
01:41:23,356 --> 01:41:24,779
Cliff Booth.

1733
01:41:25,027 --> 01:41:26,126
How do you know George?

1734
01:41:26,151 --> 01:41:28,495
I used to shoot Westerns
here at the ranch.

1735
01:41:28,661 --> 01:41:30,645
When was the last
time you saw George?

1736
01:41:30,814 --> 01:41:34,276
Oh, I'd say about...

1737
01:41:34,871 --> 01:41:36,617
eight years ago.

1738
01:41:37,682 --> 01:41:38,664
Oh.

1739
01:41:39,239 --> 01:41:41,888
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
the two of you were so close.

1740
01:41:43,098 --> 01:41:45,499
Well, when he wakes up,
I'll let him know you came by.

1741
01:41:46,017 --> 01:41:49,867
I'd really like to say a quick hello now,
while I'm here.

1742
01:41:49,919 --> 01:41:51,511
Came a long ways.

1743
01:41:51,536 --> 01:41:54,175
Don't know when I'll
get back this way again.

1744
01:41:54,728 --> 01:41:57,585
Oh, I understand but
I'm afraid that's impossible.

1745
01:41:58,088 --> 01:41:59,398
Impossible.

1746
01:41:59,735 --> 01:42:01,600
Why is that impossible?

1747
01:42:01,712 --> 01:42:03,953
Because me and George like
to watch TV on Sunday nights.

1748
01:42:03,978 --> 01:42:05,204
FBI and Bonanza

1749
01:42:05,229 --> 01:42:06,818
but George finds it hard
to keep awake that late

1750
01:42:06,858 --> 01:42:08,023
so I make him take
a nap around now

1751
01:42:08,048 --> 01:42:10,072
so I don't get tripped out
of my George's TV time.

1752
01:42:12,598 --> 01:42:14,687
Well, look, red,

1753
01:42:14,712 --> 01:42:16,453
I'm comin' in there.

1754
01:42:16,722 --> 01:42:18,145
With my own two eyes,

1755
01:42:18,170 --> 01:42:20,454
I'm gonna get a
good look at George.

1756
01:42:21,674 --> 01:42:23,304
And this...

1757
01:42:24,801 --> 01:42:26,329
ain't stoppin' me.

1758
01:42:29,772 --> 01:42:30,963
Okay.

1759
01:42:32,054 --> 01:42:33,344
Suit yourself.

1760
01:42:45,447 --> 01:42:46,883
<i>You never know.</i>

1761
01:42:48,724 --> 01:42:50,962
<i>The next boy you meet
may be the one.</i>

1762
01:43:24,021 --> 01:43:26,902
<i>So clean, it's actually
good for your skin.</i>

1763
01:43:27,194 --> 01:43:28,971
<i>So fresh and natural looking,</i>

1764
01:43:29,083 --> 01:43:30,867
<i>you're always ready for next time.</i>

1765
01:43:31,967 --> 01:43:33,523
<i>And you never know,</i>

1766
01:43:33,875 --> 01:43:36,256
<i>the next boy you meet
may be the one.</i>

1767
01:43:44,401 --> 01:43:46,063
<i>Sparkling drop of Retsyn.</i>

1768
01:43:59,458 --> 01:44:00,946
He back there?

1769
01:44:02,505 --> 01:44:04,409
Door at the end of the hallway.

1770
01:44:05,577 --> 01:44:06,807
You might have to
shake him awake,

1771
01:44:06,855 --> 01:44:08,831
I fucked his brains
out this morning.

1772
01:44:14,375 --> 01:44:16,101
He may be tired.

1773
01:44:27,988 --> 01:44:30,115
Oh, Mister Eight-Years-Ago...

1774
01:44:31,445 --> 01:44:33,017
George is blind.

1775
01:44:33,042 --> 01:44:35,344
So you'll probably have to
tell him who you are.

1776
01:45:01,268 --> 01:45:02,905
George, you awake?

1777
01:45:20,911 --> 01:45:22,180
George?

1778
01:45:24,207 --> 01:45:25,348
George?

1779
01:45:29,268 --> 01:45:30,399
George?

1780
01:45:33,064 --> 01:45:34,393
George!

1781
01:45:35,703 --> 01:45:36,813
Hi, George.

1782
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:40,320
- What's going on?
- Everything's all right.

1783
01:45:40,345 --> 01:45:42,151
I'm sorry to disturb you.

1784
01:45:42,879 --> 01:45:44,129
Who are you?

1785
01:45:44,198 --> 01:45:45,488
It's Cliff Booth.

1786
01:45:45,605 --> 01:45:48,769
Just stopped in to say hello
and see how you're doin'.

1787
01:45:48,819 --> 01:45:50,486
John Wilkes Booth?

1788
01:45:50,565 --> 01:45:51,875
Cliff Booth.

1789
01:45:54,082 --> 01:45:55,352
Who's that?

1790
01:45:55,501 --> 01:45:58,090
I-I used to shoot
Bounty Law here, George.

1791
01:45:58,360 --> 01:45:59,928
I was Rick Dalton's stunt double.

1792
01:46:00,355 --> 01:46:01,411
Who?

1793
01:46:01,436 --> 01:46:02,636
Rick Dalton.

1794
01:46:03,145 --> 01:46:04,861
The Dalton brothers...?

1795
01:46:04,901 --> 01:46:06,230
Rick Dalton.

1796
01:46:08,028 --> 01:46:09,313
Who's that?

1797
01:46:09,338 --> 01:46:11,421
He was the star of Bounty Law.

1798
01:46:12,304 --> 01:46:13,653
Who are you?

1799
01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:15,756
I was Rick's stunt double.

1800
01:46:16,770 --> 01:46:18,606
Rick... who?

1801
01:46:18,785 --> 01:46:20,491
It don't matter, George.

1802
01:46:20,702 --> 01:46:23,782
We were colleagues from the past
and I just wanted to...

1803
01:46:23,807 --> 01:46:25,950
make sure you're doin' okay.

1804
01:46:25,975 --> 01:46:27,348
I'm not doin' okay.

1805
01:46:27,373 --> 01:46:28,410
What's the matter?

1806
01:46:28,435 --> 01:46:29,863
Can't see shit!

1807
01:46:30,208 --> 01:46:31,756
Would you call that "the matter"?

1808
01:46:31,828 --> 01:46:33,509
The man can't see shit, okay?

1809
01:46:33,534 --> 01:46:34,953
I'm sorry about that.

1810
01:46:34,978 --> 01:46:38,264
I was told...
Squeaky sent me to bed.

1811
01:46:38,958 --> 01:46:41,508
Would that be the little
redhead out front?

1812
01:46:44,114 --> 01:46:46,267
What the fuck is
the matter with you?

1813
01:46:46,803 --> 01:46:48,281
First, you wake me up,

1814
01:46:48,306 --> 01:46:50,726
and now you're pretending
that I didn't tell you

1815
01:46:50,751 --> 01:46:52,845
I was fucking blind!

1816
01:46:52,924 --> 01:46:54,412
How am I gonna know

1817
01:46:54,446 --> 01:46:57,392
what the hell color
the head of the girl is

1818
01:46:57,417 --> 01:46:58,997
that's with me all the time?

1819
01:46:59,022 --> 01:47:00,798
Oh, fair enough, George.

1820
01:47:04,436 --> 01:47:06,460
No, it's all right.

1821
01:47:07,688 --> 01:47:10,515
Everyone don't need a stuntman.

1822
01:47:17,779 --> 01:47:19,793
I don't know who you are...

1823
01:47:21,817 --> 01:47:24,069
but you touched me today.

1824
01:47:25,911 --> 01:47:28,138
You came to visit me.

1825
01:47:28,550 --> 01:47:30,643
Now I gotta go back to sleep.

1826
01:47:33,177 --> 01:47:35,672
I gotta watch FBI tonight.

1827
01:47:35,697 --> 01:47:37,820
And I watch it with Squeaky.

1828
01:47:38,537 --> 01:47:41,513
She gets all pissed off
if I fall asleep.

1829
01:47:42,612 --> 01:47:45,548
What happens if
she gets pissed off, George?

1830
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:47,959
Nothin'.

1831
01:47:49,328 --> 01:47:51,768
I just don't like
to disappoint her.

1832
01:47:56,510 --> 01:48:00,062
So, you gave all these
hippies permission to be here?

1833
01:48:05,729 --> 01:48:08,220
Just who the fuck are you?

1834
01:48:08,398 --> 01:48:10,055
I'm Cliff Booth.

1835
01:48:10,293 --> 01:48:11,597
I'm your stuntman.

1836
01:48:11,622 --> 01:48:13,666
We used to work
together, George.

1837
01:48:13,944 --> 01:48:16,384
I just wanna make
sure that you're okay.

1838
01:48:16,781 --> 01:48:19,824
That all these hippies aren't
taking advantage of ya.

1839
01:48:20,558 --> 01:48:22,681
- Squeaky?
- Yeah.

1840
01:48:23,452 --> 01:48:25,426
She loves me.

1841
01:48:27,864 --> 01:48:29,798
So, suck on that.

1842
01:48:38,486 --> 01:48:40,093
Take care, George.

1843
01:48:47,023 --> 01:48:48,404
Goddammit.

1844
01:49:09,944 --> 01:49:11,720
You embarrassed me.

1845
01:49:12,524 --> 01:49:14,538
Yeah, sorry 'bout that.

1846
01:49:17,355 --> 01:49:19,041
How'd your little
talk with George go?

1847
01:49:19,101 --> 01:49:20,336
Are we kidnapping him?

1848
01:49:20,361 --> 01:49:22,127
Not the word I'd use.

1849
01:49:22,193 --> 01:49:23,275
Well, now that
you've talked to him,

1850
01:49:23,300 --> 01:49:24,495
do you believe
everything's all right?

1851
01:49:24,554 --> 01:49:26,032
Not exactly.

1852
01:49:26,677 --> 01:49:28,384
This was a mistake,
you should leave!

1853
01:49:28,474 --> 01:49:29,962
Way aheada 'ya

1854
01:49:34,428 --> 01:49:36,392
George isn't blind!

1855
01:49:36,789 --> 01:49:38,654
You're the blind one!

Oh, yeah?

Yeah.

Just gonna stash it here,

No, I don't need to

<i>Sergio Corbucci.</i>

And who's that.

1991
01:59:42,856 --> 01:59:45,110
The second best director
of Spaghetti Westerns

1992

in the whole, wide world.

1993
01:59:46,715 --> 01:59:49,549
He's doing a new Western,
it's called Nebraska Jim.

1994
01:59:49,990 --> 01:59:52,109
And because of me,

<i>and the fuss they made over him</i>

<i>and his Nebraska Jim co-star,

Rick gained almost 15 pounds.</i>

2006

Italians' way of making movies.</i>

2038

<i>He kept Rick company during his
entire six-month stay in Italy.</i>

2043
02:02:38,193 --> 02:02:40,685
However, as the two men
returned home,

2044
02:02:41,071 --> 02:02:42,523
they've come to
an understanding.

2045
02:02:42,603 --> 02:02:44,119
Here it goes now.

2046
02:02:45,306 --> 02:02:46,695
With the, uh...

2047
02:02:47,988 --> 02:02:49,623
with the new wife, I, uh...

2048
02:02:50,770 --> 02:02:53,682
I just, I-I can't afford
you anymore, Cliff.

2049
02:02:53,873 --> 02:02:54,808
You know.

2050
02:02:54,833 --> 02:02:57,552
I could barely afford
my own house anymore.

2051
02:02:57,601 --> 02:02:59,696
So, the plan is to...

2052
02:02:59,721 --> 02:03:01,263
sell the house and buy...

2053
02:03:01,288 --> 02:03:03,447
buy a condo i-in Toluca Lake,

2054
02:03:03,518 --> 02:03:06,584
bank the money, you know,
live off it, that type of thing.

2055
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:09,476
Hopefully I'll score
come next pilot season.

2056
02:03:10,082 --> 02:03:11,319
It's a good plan.

2057
02:03:11,344 --> 02:03:12,440
Yeah.

2058
02:03:13,513 --> 02:03:16,683
But I don't know if I
have a career or not, if...

2059
02:03:16,809 --> 02:03:19,768
I'm a solid Los Angeles
citizen like Eddie O'Brien says

2060
02:03:19,802 --> 02:03:22,590
or if I'm
one step closer to

2061
02:03:22,651 --> 02:03:24,166
going back to Missouri.

2062
02:03:25,091 --> 02:03:27,639
When this whole European
journey's over,

2063
02:03:27,694 --> 02:03:29,472
I think we've, uh...

2064
02:03:30,602 --> 02:03:32,672
we've reached the
end of the trail, Cliff.

2065

02:12:22,205 --> 02:12:24,895
A cigarette dipped in acid.
What's that do?

2221
02:12:25,016 --> 02:12:26,380
You smoke it, it gets you high.

2222
02:12:26,405 --> 02:12:28,548
- How much?
- 50 cents.

2223
02:12:30,374 --> 02:12:31,478
50 cents.

2224
02:12:31,996 --> 02:12:33,600
Hippie girl, 50 cents.

Why not?

2250
02:15:18,535 --> 02:15:19,647

2251
02:15:19,805 --> 02:15:21,059
And who are you here to see, huh?

2252
02:15:21,149 --> 02:15:23,736
Nobody, sir. We just got lost.
I'm a little turned around.

2253
02:15:23,801 --> 02:15:25,102
Ah, horseshit.

2254

Fuckin' hippies came up here to
smoke dope on a dark road, huh?

Look, we're really
sorry we disturbed you.

Look, chief,
you don't belong here.

2258
02:15:38,599 --> 02:15:40,563

All right, well, just give me
a moment to turn it around.

2264
02:16:02,724 --> 02:16:04,549
Well, drive it backwards, numbnuts.

What did Charlie say?

2279
02:16:55,597 --> 02:16:56,777
He said...

2280
02:16:56,851 --> 02:16:58,621
"Go to Terry's old house

2281
02:16:58,692 --> 02:17:00,637
"and kill everybody in there."

2282
02:17:01,086 --> 02:17:02,625
And you heard him yourself.

2283
02:17:03,016 --> 02:17:04,826
He said make it witchy.

2284
02:17:05,050 --> 02:17:07,487
Now, he either said that...

2285
02:17:07,899 --> 02:17:09,645
or I'm a liar.

2286
02:17:11,081 --> 02:17:12,867
Now, are anyone o' you...

2287
02:17:12,923 --> 02:17:14,208
calling me a liar?

2288
02:17:15,258 --> 02:17:16,226
Hmm?

2289
02:17:17,260 --> 02:17:18,498
How about you?

2290
02:17:18,998 --> 02:17:20,657
Are you calling me a liar?

2291
02:17:21,947 --> 02:17:23,519
No, of course not.

2292
02:17:24,086 --> 02:17:25,054
Good.

2293
02:17:25,125 --> 02:17:26,284
Hold it.

2294
02:17:26,594 --> 02:17:28,197
Was that Rick Dalton?

2295
02:17:28,289 --> 02:17:29,273
Who?

2296
02:17:29,337 --> 02:17:30,455
The guy from Bounty Law.

2297
02:17:30,487 --> 02:17:31,654
Who, Jake Cahill?

2298
02:17:31,696 --> 02:17:34,919
Yeah! That guy in the road
was Jake Cahill.

2299
02:17:34,947 --> 02:17:36,241
Ho... wait a minute.

2300
02:17:36,289 --> 02:17:38,916
That was fucking Jake Cahill
that just yelled at us?

2301
02:17:39,314 --> 02:17:41,156
He was older,
but yeah, I think so.

2302
02:17:41,198 --> 02:17:42,436
Who's this Rick guy?

2303
02:17:42,471 --> 02:17:44,383
Jesus Christ, Sadie,
get it together!

2304
02:17:44,426 --> 02:17:45,727
Rick Dalton played Jake Cahill

2305
02:17:45,752 --> 02:17:47,981
on a cowboy show in the
50s called Bounty Law.

2306
02:17:48,063 --> 02:17:49,761
Fuck you, Katie.

2307
02:17:49,794 --> 02:17:52,945
Sorry I don't know the name of
every fascist dog TV in the 50s.

2308
02:17:53,068 --> 02:17:55,806
I can't believe that
asshole in the road

2309
02:17:55,846 --> 02:17:57,509
was Jake Cahill!

2310
02:17:57,590 --> 02:18:00,511
When I was a kid,
I had a Bounty Law lunch box.

2311
02:18:00,537 --> 02:18:03,481
That was my favorite
of all my lunch boxes.

2312
02:18:04,199 --> 02:18:06,160
Dig this...

2313
02:18:06,989 --> 02:18:08,703
You've been having
our trip session,

2314
02:18:08,728 --> 02:18:11,215
I've been expanding on
this one idea in my head.

2315
02:18:11,715 --> 02:18:13,001
Alright, dig it.

2316
02:18:13,263 --> 02:18:15,541
We all grew up watchin' TV,
you know what I mean?

2317
02:18:16,666 --> 02:18:18,610
And if you grew up watchin' TV,

2318
02:18:18,674 --> 02:18:20,531
that means you grew up
watchin' murder.

2319
02:18:21,421 --> 02:18:24,739
Every show on TV
that wasn't I-I Love Lucy

2320
02:18:24,810 --> 02:18:26,009
was about murder.

2321
02:18:26,362 --> 02:18:28,672
So, my idea is...

2322
02:18:29,223 --> 02:18:31,715
we kill the people
who taught us to kill.

2323
02:18:33,688 --> 02:18:35,220
I mean, where the
fuck are we, man?

2324
02:18:35,268 --> 02:18:37,633
We are in fucking Hollywood, man!

2325
02:18:37,685 --> 02:18:39,209
The people an entire generation

2326
02:18:39,234 --> 02:18:41,527
grew up watching kill
people live here.

2327
02:18:41,662 --> 02:18:43,939
And they live in
pigshit fucking luxury.

2328
02:18:44,031 --> 02:18:45,206
I say, fuck 'em.

2329
02:18:45,264 --> 02:18:47,607
I say we cut their cocks up
and make 'em eat it.

2330
02:18:48,313 --> 02:18:50,051
That's a great idea, Sadie.

2331
02:18:52,581 --> 02:18:54,438
You two ready to kill some pigs?

2332
02:19:03,744 --> 02:19:04,839
Wait a minute.

2333
02:19:05,005 --> 02:19:06,093
Uh, shit.

2334
02:19:06,299 --> 02:19:08,482
Sor... I forgot my knife
in the car.

2335
02:19:09,120 --> 02:19:10,525
Can I go-
Can I go back and get it?

2336
02:19:11,666 --> 02:19:13,141
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

2337
02:19:13,658 --> 02:19:14,920
- Wait a minute.
- What?

2338
02:19:14,991 --> 02:19:17,150
I locked the car.
You'll need keys to get in.

2339
02:19:20,331 --> 02:19:21,228
Oh.

2340
02:19:21,490 --> 02:19:22,426
Right.

2341
02:19:22,760 --> 02:19:23,736
Thank you.

2342
02:19:23,871 --> 02:19:25,405
Okay. I'll be right back.

2343
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:27,240
Hurry up.

2344
02:19:27,265 --> 02:19:29,026
Yes, uh, just-just a little minute.

2345
02:19:39,412 --> 02:19:40,999
Ooh, that fucking bitch!

2346
02:19:41,062 --> 02:19:42,229
Shhh, calm down.

2347
02:19:42,320 --> 02:19:43,828
There's a fuckin'
house right there.

2348
02:19:45,459 --> 02:19:46,538
What do we do now?

2349
02:19:46,617 --> 02:19:48,094
Well, we do
what we came to do.

2350
02:19:48,167 --> 02:19:50,407
And when we're done, we just
split up and hitch home.

2351
02:19:51,011 --> 02:19:53,193
Any more questions, hmm?

2352
02:19:55,564 --> 02:19:56,881
Okay, pig killers.

2353
02:19:56,961 --> 02:19:58,389
Let's kill some piggies.

2354
02:20:12,427 --> 02:20:14,031
Oh, somebody's hungry.

2355
02:20:23,017 --> 02:20:24,041

2356
02:20:26,144 --> 02:20:27,478

2357

to get into it tonight.

2379
02:24:11,257 --> 02:24:13,980
Haa... can I help you?

2380
02:24:20,528 --> 02:24:21,496
Shit.

2381
02:24:22,865 --> 02:24:24,476
How many other
people are here?

2382
02:24:24,777 --> 02:24:27,079
Oh, just the one sleepin'
on the back there.

2383
02:24:29,005 --> 02:24:31,132
Well, get him, bring him
into the living room.

2384
02:24:32,366 --> 02:24:33,572
What if he says no?

2385
02:24:33,597 --> 02:24:35,550
Don't take no for an answer.
You're the one with the knife.

2386
02:24:35,575 --> 02:24:36,709
Get him in here!

2387
02:24:39,848 --> 02:24:40,808
Hey.

2388
02:24:46,688 --> 02:24:48,061
You are real, right?

2389
02:24:48,738 --> 02:24:51,619
We're as real as a doughnut,
motherfucker.

2390
02:25:09,825 --> 02:25:10,935
Go to the living room.

2391
02:25:10,960 --> 02:25:12,356
What is going on-ah?

2392
02:25:17,649 --> 02:25:18,586
Go!

2393
02:25:18,611 --> 02:25:19,420
Okay.

2394
02:25:21,709 --> 02:25:22,796
Who the fuck's that?

2395
02:25:23,149 --> 02:25:24,149
I don't know.

2396
02:25:25,387 --> 02:25:26,545
Francesca.

2397
02:25:33,650 --> 02:25:34,618
Oh...

2398
02:25:35,231 --> 02:25:36,660
Uh, wha...?

2399
02:25:37,910 --> 02:25:39,386
Oh, I know you.

2400
02:25:39,759 --> 02:25:41,330
I know all three of you.

2401
02:25:42,670 --> 02:25:44,503
Yeah! Spahn Ranch!

2402
02:25:45,560 --> 02:25:47,203
Spahn Ranch, yeah.

2403
02:25:47,290 --> 02:25:48,402
Hoo!

2404
02:25:49,660 --> 02:25:51,295
I don't know your name, but...

2405
02:25:51,383 --> 02:25:52,907
I remember that hair.

2406
02:25:53,752 --> 02:25:56,379
And you, I remember
your white, little face.

2407
02:25:56,929 --> 02:25:59,159
And you were on a horsie!

2408
02:25:59,881 --> 02:26:00,785
Yeah.

2409
02:26:01,799 --> 02:26:04,093
Uh... you are...

2410
02:26:04,450 --> 02:26:05,823
I'm the devil.

2411
02:26:06,359 --> 02:26:09,201
And I'm here to do
the devil's business.

2412
02:26:12,416 --> 02:26:15,948
Nah, it was dumber than that,
somethin' like... Rex...

2413
02:26:16,059 --> 02:26:17,423
Gad, shoot 'im, Tex!

2414
02:26:17,448 --> 02:26:18,448
Tex!

2415
02:26:37,456 --> 02:26:39,003
Son of a bitch!

2416
02:27:17,871 --> 02:27:19,006
Hey, you.

2417
02:27:21,537 --> 02:27:23,823
How dare you come into
my house, motherfucker!

2418
02:27:35,947 --> 02:27:39,790
<i>♪ Keep me hangin' on ♪</i>

2419
02:27:41,778 --> 02:27:43,403
<i>♪ Get out of my life ♪</i>

2420
02:27:43,589 --> 02:27:45,700

2421
02:27:47,076 --> 02:27:48,997

2422
02:27:49,116 --> 02:27:51,044
<i>♪ Why don't you babe? ♪</i>

2423
02:28:44,399 --> 02:28:46,082
What the fuck?!

2424
02:28:47,320 --> 02:28:48,621
Jesus Christ!

2425
02:30:05,376 --> 02:30:06,607
Holy shit.

2426
02:30:09,892 --> 02:30:11,051
Francesca!

2427
02:30:11,329 --> 02:30:12,583
Francesca, honey!

2428
02:30:33,945 --> 02:30:36,484
<i>Sir, around what time was it that
you confronted the intruders?</i>

2429
02:30:37,105 --> 02:30:40,385
<i>About, uh, about midnight...
around midnight.</i>

2430
02:30:40,537 --> 02:30:41,862
<i>How do you know it was midnight?</i>

2431
02:30:42,023 --> 02:30:45,507
<i>Well... I was, uh...
I was in the kitchen, uh...</i>

2432
02:30:46,002 --> 02:30:47,836
<i>makin' margaritas and, uh...</i>

2433
02:30:48,556 --> 02:30:51,104
<i>I heard the sound
of a noisy muffler,</i>

2434
02:30:51,191 --> 02:30:53,241
<i>I looked up at the
clock, it said, uh...</i>

2435
02:30:53,266 --> 02:30:54,765
<i>the kitchen clock said midnight.</i>

2436
02:30:54,919 --> 02:30:56,704
<i>12:00 exactly?</i>

2437
02:30:56,861 --> 02:30:59,729
It could've been 12:05,
somethin' like that.

2438
02:30:59,754 --> 02:31:00,801
And you didn't see 'em again

2439
02:31:00,826 --> 02:31:02,579
until the woman attacked
you in the pool?

2440
02:31:03,498 --> 02:31:04,633
No. No.

2441
02:31:05,562 --> 02:31:07,554
What did these perpetrators do?

2442
02:31:07,689 --> 02:31:09,911
Perpetrators?
They were hippie assholes.

2443
02:31:10,503 --> 02:31:13,280
Two of 'em burst through
the front door there...

2444
02:31:14,022 --> 02:31:17,538
And the guy hippie said
he was the devil.

2445
02:31:18,448 --> 02:31:20,408
And he said, "I'm here to...

2446
02:31:21,264 --> 02:31:23,479
do some... devil shit."

2447
02:31:23,559 --> 02:31:25,440
It's not verbatim, but...

2448
02:31:26,199 --> 02:31:27,295
Some devil shit?

2449
02:31:42,793 --> 02:31:45,000
And away we go!

2450
02:31:48,894 --> 02:31:50,917
W-W-Wait a minute.

2451
02:31:51,005 --> 02:31:53,338
What hospital you goin' to, Cliff?
I'll meet you there, huh?

2452
02:31:53,485 --> 02:31:55,827
Ah, you don't wanna
meet me in no hospital.

2453
02:31:56,104 --> 02:31:57,882
Why don't you take
care of your lady?

2454
02:31:57,934 --> 02:32:01,030
Hey, she just took five
fuckin' sleeping pills.

2455
02:32:01,144 --> 02:32:03,080
She'll be asleep
till Columbus Day.

2456
02:32:03,140 --> 02:32:04,146
You guys'll probably have to

2457
02:32:04,171 --> 02:32:06,369
come out here again
just to wake her ass up.

2458
02:32:06,602 --> 02:32:08,895
Hey, I'm not gonna die,
I may get a limp

2459
02:32:08,920 --> 02:32:11,602
but I ain't gonna die,
it's not my time yet, man.

2460
02:32:11,704 --> 02:32:14,299
All right? No use waitin'
in some waitin' room.

2461
02:32:14,324 --> 02:32:17,087
Why don't you go lie naked
with that fine creature?

2462
02:32:17,565 --> 02:32:20,160
Come visit me tomorrow.
Bring bagels.

2463
02:32:21,974 --> 02:32:24,180
You wanna do somethin' for me,
check on Brandy.

2464
02:32:24,205 --> 02:32:26,278
She may be a little
shook up after that.

2465
02:32:26,303 --> 02:32:27,354
She may wanna sleep with ya.

2466
02:32:27,379 --> 02:32:28,616
Are you kiddin' me?

2467
02:32:28,664 --> 02:32:30,235
She's sleeping with
Francesca right now.

2468
02:32:30,260 --> 02:32:31,864
You might never get her back.

2469
02:32:32,795 --> 02:32:33,706
We gotta go.

2470
02:32:33,731 --> 02:32:35,254
All right then, Cliff.

2471
02:32:35,889 --> 02:32:36,968
See you tomorrow, then.

2472
02:32:40,427 --> 02:32:41,990
Hey! Hey...

2473
02:32:45,726 --> 02:32:47,384
You're a good friend, Cliff.

2474
02:32:49,012 --> 02:32:50,298
I try.

2475
02:33:22,519 --> 02:33:23,591
Hello?

2476
02:33:25,515 --> 02:33:26,539
Hey.

2477
02:33:26,658 --> 02:33:28,936
I'm Jay Sebring, I'm a
friend of the Polanskis.

2478
02:33:29,655 --> 02:33:31,821
You're Rick Dalton, right?

2479
02:33:32,459 --> 02:33:35,563
Yeah, yeah... I'm Rick Dalton.

2480
02:33:36,072 --> 02:33:37,977
- I live next door.
- Oh, I know.

2481
02:33:38,002 --> 02:33:40,724
I tease Sharon that she lives
next door to Jake Cahill.

2482
02:33:40,903 --> 02:33:42,831
If she ever wants to put
a bounty on Roman's head,

2483
02:33:42,871 --> 02:33:44,458
she just has to go
next door, right?

2484
02:33:46,261 --> 02:33:47,420
No shit?

2485
02:33:48,126 --> 02:33:50,476
What the fuck happened?

2486
02:33:50,677 --> 02:33:54,352
Oh, these... these fucking
hippie weirdos, th-they...

2487
02:33:54,424 --> 02:33:55,947
they broke into my house.

2488
02:33:56,539 --> 02:33:58,071
What do you mean,
like, trying to rob you?

2489
02:33:58,211 --> 02:34:00,060
I don't know what
the fuck they wanted...

2490
02:34:00,306 --> 02:34:02,369
Were they robbin' me?
I don't know, were they...

2491
02:34:02,443 --> 02:34:04,284
freakin' out on
some bummer trip?

2492
02:34:04,309 --> 02:34:05,654
Who knows, but...

2493
02:34:05,679 --> 02:34:07,742
they tried to kill
my wife and my buddy.

2494
02:34:07,845 --> 02:34:09,291
Jesus Christ, are you serious?

2495
02:34:09,332 --> 02:34:11,166
Yeah, I'm fuckin' serious.

2496
02:34:11,303 --> 02:34:14,478
My buddy and his dog
killed two of 'em, and, uh...

2497
02:34:15,144 --> 02:34:17,946
shit, I... torched the last one.

2498
02:34:18,165 --> 02:34:20,038
- Torched?
- Yeah.

2499
02:34:20,395 --> 02:34:22,062
I burned her ass to a crisp.

2500
02:34:22,704 --> 02:34:23,807
How'd you do that?

2501
02:34:24,038 --> 02:34:25,522
Believe it or not, I...

2502
02:34:25,887 --> 02:34:27,989
I got a flamethrower
in my tool shed.

2503
02:34:28,014 --> 02:34:30,257
From The 14 Fists of McCluskey?

2504
02:34:30,647 --> 02:34:31,758
Yeah!

2505
02:34:32,748 --> 02:34:33,732
Yeah.

2506
02:34:33,757 --> 02:34:35,621
Th-That's the one.

2507
02:34:35,696 --> 02:34:37,267
It still works, too.

2508
02:34:37,394 --> 02:34:38,593
Thank God.

2509
02:34:38,884 --> 02:34:40,495
Hey, is everybody okay?

2510
02:34:40,559 --> 02:34:41,757
Well...

2511
02:34:41,919 --> 02:34:43,252
the fuckin' hippies aren't.

2512
02:34:43,310 --> 02:34:44,564
That's for goddamn sure.

2513
02:34:44,628 --> 02:34:45,728
Yeah.

2514
02:34:45,753 --> 02:34:47,586
But I'm fine, you know, uh...

2515
02:34:47,695 --> 02:34:49,695
my wife's fine, we're just, uh...

2516
02:34:49,809 --> 02:34:51,468
a little shook up, is all.

2517
02:34:51,566 --> 02:34:53,111
Oh, my God, that's terrifying.

2518
02:34:53,569 --> 02:34:54,632
Yeah.

2519
02:34:54,950 --> 02:34:57,577
<i>Jay, honey,
is everything all right?</i>

2520
02:34:57,735 --> 02:34:59,410
Everything's okay now, honey.

2521
02:34:59,555 --> 02:35:02,468
Uh, but hippies broke
into the house next door.

2522
02:35:02,750 --> 02:35:04,195
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

2523
02:35:04,556 --> 02:35:06,074
<i>Well, that's terrifying.</i>

2524
02:35:06,643 --> 02:35:08,238
<i>Is everybody okay?</i>

2525
02:35:08,438 --> 02:35:12,026
I'm talking to your next door
neighbor about it right now.

2526
02:35:12,430 --> 02:35:13,827
<i>Rick Dalton?</i>

2527
02:35:15,469 --> 02:35:17,327
Yeah! That's me.

2528
02:35:18,033 --> 02:35:20,612
<i>Oh! Well, hello, neighbor.</i>

2529
02:35:21,318 --> 02:35:22,755
<i>Everybody okay?</i>

2530
02:35:23,294 --> 02:35:26,333
Yes, yes, Sharon,
e-everybody's fine.

2531
02:35:26,678 --> 02:35:28,059
<i>Are you okay?</i>

2532
02:35:28,464 --> 02:35:30,607
Yes, I am, thank you
for asking that.

2533
02:35:31,681 --> 02:35:34,188
<i>Rick, would you like to come
up to the house for a drink</i>

2534
02:35:34,213 --> 02:35:35,681
<i>and meet my other friends?</i>

2535
02:35:42,341 --> 02:35:45,325
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

2536
02:35:45,397 --> 02:35:48,238
<i>Oh, hooray!
