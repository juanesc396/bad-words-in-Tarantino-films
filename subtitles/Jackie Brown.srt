Welcome aboard. Welcome aboard.

51
00:04:13,923 --> 00:04:18,496
<i>Hi, I'm Sidney. I'm a personal trainer
and Miss Orange County finalist.</i>

52
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,950
<i>- And this is my TEC-9.</i>
- That there is a TEC-9.

53
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,945
Little cheap-ass spray gun
made outta South Miami.

54
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,245
It retail for 380,
I get 'em for 2, sell 'em for 8.

55
00:04:27,276 --> 00:04:30,939
They advertise this TEC-9 as
the most popular gun in American crime.

56
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:34,334
Can you believe that shit? It actually says
that in the little booklet that comes with it.

57
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,965
"The most popular gun in American
crime." Like they're proud of that shit.

58
00:04:38,007 --> 00:04:40,489
<i>I love my TEC-9.</i>

59
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:43,498
Let me run this up.

60
00:04:43,572 --> 00:04:46,006
<i>- Design emphasis behind this weapon.</i>
- Check out this gun here.

61
00:04:46,074 --> 00:04:48,804
This here is a Styer Aug.

62
00:04:48,877 --> 00:04:51,209
Styer Aug's a bad motherfucker.
Listen.

63
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:56,682
Ooh! That shit's
expensive too, man.

64
00:04:56,752 --> 00:04:58,048
Made in Austria.

65
00:04:58,068 --> 00:05:01,848
My customers don't know shit about it,
so there ain't no demand for it.

66
00:05:01,923 --> 00:05:05,689
Baby, I really could use me
some more ice.

67
00:05:08,382 --> 00:05:10,509
Hold it. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

68
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:14,243
Let me tell you, though, man.

69
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:17,530
You put this bad boy in a flick,
every motherfucker out there want one.

70
00:05:17,606 --> 00:05:19,074
I'm serious as a heart attack.

71
00:05:19,114 --> 00:05:23,271
When them Hong Kong flicks came out, every
nigger in the world had to have a .45.

72
00:05:23,345 --> 00:05:25,313
And they ain't want one,
they want two,

73
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,314
'cause all them niggers
want to be the killer.

74
00:05:27,382 --> 00:05:29,714
But what them flicks don't tell you
and what they don't know...

75
00:05:29,785 --> 00:05:32,549
is that a .45 got a serious
fuckin' jammin' problem.

76
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:35,055
Now, I try to steer my customers
toward a 9 millimetre...

77
00:05:35,123 --> 00:05:38,388
'cause it's damn near the same weapon and
it ain't got half the jammin' problems.

78
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,827
But you know how them niggers is
out there. You can't tell 'em shit.

79
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:46,163
They want a .45.
The killer had a .45, they want a .45.

80
00:05:47,502 --> 00:05:50,764
- Thanks, baby.
- Mm-hmm.

81
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:54,837
- Who's your partner?
- Cat named Mr. Walker. Runs a fishing boat out of Mexico.

82
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,108
I get the merchandise to him, he gets it out
to my customers, on all my bulk sales anyway.

83
00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:03,301
Before I set that nigger up, he didn't have a
pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of.

84
00:06:03,354 --> 00:06:06,681
Now that motherfucker
rollin' in cash.

85
00:06:06,755 --> 00:06:10,401
Got hisself a yacht with all kind
of high-tech navigational shit on it.

86
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,479
Oh, uh-uh-uh, here we go.

87
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:17,746
AK-47, the very best there is.

88
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,826
When you absolutely, positively got
to kill every motherfucker in the room,

89
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,817
accept no substitutes.

90
00:06:25,774 --> 00:06:28,436
<i>Nothing gets
between me and my AK.</i>

91
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,035
This here is the Chinese model.

92
00:06:31,112 --> 00:06:34,240
I get 'em for 850 and double my money.

93
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:36,856
Grab that for me,
would ya, baby?

94
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:39,651
You know it's for you.

95
00:06:39,721 --> 00:06:41,814
Girl, don't make me
put my foot in your ass.

96
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:46,156
<i>The AK-47 is the most
popular assault rifle in the world.</i>

97
00:06:46,228 --> 00:06:50,756
<i>This is the Chinese model. You can tell
by the extra rivets running through...</i>

98
00:06:53,101 --> 00:06:55,160
Hello? It's for you.

99
00:07:06,281 --> 00:07:09,580
Yo, Junebug. What's up?

100
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,995
Yep. Still hanging with
that stripper Chantelle?

101
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:18,243
Boring, isn't it?

102
00:07:19,246 --> 00:07:21,046
I can sit through it once.

103
00:07:21,095 --> 00:07:23,086
Thinks he's Joe Gunn now.

104
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:26,039
Well, I'm impressed.
He seems to know a lot.

105
00:07:26,086 --> 00:07:28,263
He's just repeating shit
he overheard.

106
00:07:28,336 --> 00:07:30,429
He ain't any more
of a gun expert than I am.

107
00:07:31,205 --> 00:07:33,929
- You want?
- Sure.

108
00:07:33,942 --> 00:07:36,838
<i>It shoots
500 rounds of full metal jacket,</i>

109
00:07:36,865 --> 00:07:40,946
<i>9-millimeter Luger
at 1,270 feet per second.</i>

110
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:45,276
<i>At ten pounds, it's really heavy
for such a small gun.</i>

111
00:07:45,316 --> 00:07:48,685
- Demi Moore.
<i>- Really reduce muzzle lights during firing.</i>

<i>I've never held anything

113
00:07:55,336 --> 00:07:58,354
So when'd you get out of jail?

114
00:07:59,216 --> 00:08:00,696
Four days ago.

115
00:08:01,122 --> 00:08:04,216
- Where at?
- Susanville.

116
00:08:04,738 --> 00:08:06,933
How long?

117
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:09,537
About two months shy
of four years.

118
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:11,951
Four years?

119
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,680
- For what?
- Bank robbery.

120
00:08:15,637 --> 00:08:16,683
Really?

121
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:21,683
- Aight. Later.
- Shit, I'm impressed.

122
00:08:21,756 --> 00:08:24,859
Ha-ha. See what
I'm talking about?

123
00:08:24,892 --> 00:08:27,184
Now, that was about
a man in New York...

124
00:08:27,262 --> 00:08:31,164
wants a 9-milimeter Smith and Wesson,
model 5946.

125
00:08:31,232 --> 00:08:32,867
And why does he want it?

126
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,067
'Cause it's the same gun that nigger
on New York Undercover uses.

127
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:39,664
'Cause of that nigger,
I'm gonna make 1,250 off of this nigger.

128
00:08:39,813 --> 00:08:42,285
So... What's your cost?

129
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:45,302
Low as two.

130
00:08:45,547 --> 00:08:48,008
- You're serious?
- I'm telling you, Louis.

131
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:51,484
Start adding these figures up, tell me
this ain't the business to be in.

132
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:13,606
- Oh, I got me five M-60 machine guns too.
- Hello.

133
00:09:13,675 --> 00:09:16,166
Motherfuckers come straight
out the Gulf War.

134
00:09:16,244 --> 00:09:18,804
I already sold 3 of them,
20 grand a piece.

135
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,611
- Wow, that's good money.
- I'm gonna make a million dollars out of this, man.

136
00:09:22,684 --> 00:09:25,346
I already got a half million
sittin' down in Mexico.

137
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,912
When I deliver this next load,
it'll get me another half mill.

138
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,924
- Then what?
- Then I'm out.

139
00:09:30,992 --> 00:09:33,688
Spend the rest
of my life spending.

140
00:09:33,762 --> 00:09:36,356
<i>Pull the trigger and let her rip!</i>

141
00:09:39,768 --> 00:09:42,032
<i>Hi, my name is Melinda.</i>

142
00:09:47,075 --> 00:09:50,704
- Well, you gonna tell me who it is?
- It's Beaumont.

143
00:09:56,604 --> 00:09:58,595
Don't clown on me, bitch.

144
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:03,557
Beaumont, what's up?

145
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,116
What the fuck you doin' in jail?

146
00:10:06,194 --> 00:10:08,662
What the fuck
you doin' that for?

147
00:10:11,351 --> 00:10:12,399
Goddamn, nigger.

148
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:16,631
Ain't you got better sense than to be
drunk driving with a goddamn pistol?

149
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:18,791
Beaumont.

150
00:10:18,812 --> 00:10:22,872
Beaumont.

151
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:27,087
Listen to me. Yeah, number one,
you gots to chill.

152
00:10:27,147 --> 00:10:28,629
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
'course you're scared.

153
00:10:28,676 --> 00:10:31,281
That's what the motherfuckers get
paid for, to scare the shit out of you.

154
00:10:31,352 --> 00:10:33,377
That's their motherfucking job.

155
00:10:33,621 --> 00:10:35,323
The judge doesn't give a fuck about that.

156
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,626
He's ready to habitualise you.
Is that what you want?

157
00:10:38,693 --> 00:10:40,684
You wanna look at ten years?

158
00:10:40,762 --> 00:10:45,461
Tomorrow I'll get you out, I promise, but
that means I gotta pick you up tonight.

159
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:47,967
Reggie, there ain't
no two ways about it.

160
00:10:48,036 --> 00:10:51,767
You're gonna spend the night in jail, but I
already told you I'm gonna get you out tomorrow.

161
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,174
Now, where are you?
You're at your mother's?

162
00:10:56,677 --> 00:10:58,611
Put your mother on.

163
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,770
Miss Gillmore. Miss Gilmore,
this is Max Cherry.

164
00:11:02,811 --> 00:11:05,997
This is Reggie's...
That's right, his bail bondsman.

165
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,056
Look, Reggie is in big trouble.

166
00:11:09,124 --> 00:11:12,560
I want to pick him up, and I want you
to be responsible for him before I...

167
00:11:12,627 --> 00:11:14,561
Sit down.

168
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:17,928
Yeah, I'd like you to make sure
that he's there when I get there.

169
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:20,829
And look, this is
a second chance for him.

170
00:11:20,855 --> 00:11:24,315
They don't get...
That's correct.

171
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:28,674
All right. So I'm counting on you
to help me help your son.

172
00:11:28,743 --> 00:11:31,974
Thank you very much.
Put him back on the line, please.

173
00:11:32,046 --> 00:11:36,117
All right, Reggie, we're clear on this.
You got it? Good.

174
00:11:36,157 --> 00:11:41,652
Do yourself a really big favour
and be there when I get there.

175
00:11:43,556 --> 00:11:45,523
How can I help you?

176
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:48,153
Where can I put my ash?

177
00:11:51,218 --> 00:11:53,379
Use that cup there, if you like.

178
00:11:54,558 --> 00:11:57,784
Oh, and I need me a bond
for 10,000.

179
00:11:57,811 --> 00:12:01,534
- You all right out there?
- Yeah.

180
00:12:02,008 --> 00:12:04,806
- Have some coffee?
- Go right ahead.

181
00:12:04,926 --> 00:12:08,748
Who's that big, Mandingo-looking nigger you
got up there on that picture with you?

182
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:11,195
- That's Winston. He works here.
- Damn!

183
00:12:11,258 --> 00:12:14,555
He's a big 'un, ain't he?
Y'all tight?

184
00:12:14,615 --> 00:12:17,675
- Yeah.
- But you're his boss, though, right?

185
00:12:17,691 --> 00:12:19,057
Yeah.

186
00:12:19,086 --> 00:12:21,850
Bet it was your idea to take
that picture, too, wasn't it?

187
00:12:23,865 --> 00:12:26,857
All right,
you want a $10,000 bond?

188
00:12:26,935 --> 00:12:30,666
- What have you got to put up for collateral?
- I'm gonna have to use cash.

189
00:12:30,738 --> 00:12:34,970
- You have it with you?
- Got it right here in my rapper bag.

190
00:12:35,043 --> 00:12:38,274
- You have cash. What do you need me for?
- Come on, man.

191
00:12:38,346 --> 00:12:40,074
You know how they do.

192
00:12:40,114 --> 00:12:44,284
Black man show up with 10,000 cash, first
thing they wanna know is where I got it.

193
00:12:44,352 --> 00:12:47,844
Then they gonna want to keep a big chunk
of it, start talkin' that court-cost shit.

194
00:12:47,922 --> 00:12:50,482
Fuck that noise, Jack.
I go through you.

195
00:12:51,358 --> 00:12:53,451
Cost you a thousand
for the bond.

196
00:12:53,531 --> 00:12:55,491
I can do that.

197
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,658
Who's it for? A relative?

198
00:12:57,705 --> 00:13:00,231
A fellow named Beaumont.
They got him down in County.

199
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:03,935
Started out drunk driving, but they wrote
it up as possession of a concealed weapon.

200
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:07,839
- Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
- Ten thousand sounds high.

201
00:13:08,075 --> 00:13:10,942
They run his name, got a hit.
He been inside.

202
00:13:11,011 --> 00:13:13,582
Plus, he from Kentucky, and I think
they're kind of prejudiced...

203
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:16,600
against brothers
from down South out here.

204
00:13:16,657 --> 00:13:20,143
If he runs, and I have to go
to Kentucky to bring him back,

205
00:13:20,227 --> 00:13:22,161
you pay the expenses.

206
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,617
You think you can do that?

207
00:13:24,618 --> 00:13:28,282
I've done it.
What's his full name?

208
00:13:28,315 --> 00:13:31,079
Beaumont. That's all I know.

209
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:36,564
Would you say that Beaumont
is his first or his last name?

210
00:13:36,638 --> 00:13:40,301
Uh, if I had to guess,
I'd say Beaumont's his Christian name.

211
00:13:42,561 --> 00:13:43,674
Records office.

212
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:48,650
Hello, this is Max Cherry,
Cherry Bail Bonds. Who's this, please?

213
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:51,610
- Ordell, I'm gonna wait in the car.
- Hi, Vicki.

214
00:13:51,646 --> 00:13:54,672
All right, man. Cool.
We're almost done here, right?

215
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:57,522
- Gettin' there.
- Yo, yo.

216
00:13:57,592 --> 00:14:01,494
You check out some music while you're
sitting in the car. Take the keys.

217
00:14:01,562 --> 00:14:04,759
- Which one's for the car?
- Uh, this one right here.

218
00:14:04,832 --> 00:14:08,836
Use that little black thing to turn off
the alarm and unlock the door.

219
00:14:08,896 --> 00:14:10,700
- What do I do?
- You ain't gotta do nothing, man.

220
00:14:10,736 --> 00:14:13,366
Just point it at the car, push the
button, you hear a little "ooh-ooh-ooh."

221
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:15,668
That means the door's unlocked
and the alarm's off. Get in.

222
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,567
Okay.

223
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:20,643
Play the volume loud as you want to,
but don't touch my levels now.

224
00:14:20,715 --> 00:14:23,183
- I got them set just like I like 'em.
- Okay.

225
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:36,809
Beaumont Livingston.

226
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:39,158
Livingston, huh?

227
00:14:39,562 --> 00:14:43,693
On his prior, he served nine months.
He's working on four years' probation.

228
00:14:43,771 --> 00:14:47,002
- You don't say.
- You know what he's out on probation for?

229
00:14:47,075 --> 00:14:51,739
- Ain't got a clue.
- Possession of unregistered machine guns.

230
00:14:51,813 --> 00:14:56,079
Damn. Now, they're gonna consider
that a violation of his probation?

231
00:14:56,823 --> 00:15:00,189
They do consider this
a violation of his probation.

232
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:02,349
- Your boy's looking at ten years,
- Mm.

233
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:04,516
...plus the concealed weapon.

234
00:15:04,592 --> 00:15:09,928
He ain't gonna like that. Beaumont ain't
got a doing-time kind of disposition.

235
00:15:11,812 --> 00:15:14,759
- I need your name and address.
- Ordell Robbie.

236
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:16,895
O-R-D-E-L-L...

237
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:19,098
R-O-B-B-I-E.

238
00:15:19,173 --> 00:15:21,899
1436 Florence Boulevard,

239
00:15:21,956 --> 00:15:25,517
Compton, 90222.

240
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:31,155
- Is that a house or an apartment?
- That's a house.

241
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:39,616
Who the fuck is this?

242
00:15:39,642 --> 00:15:41,654
It's your benefactor, nigger.
I'm comin' up.

243
00:15:41,729 --> 00:15:44,357
Come on up, nigger. It's open.

244
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:46,954
<i>My pleasure of living...</i>

245
00:15:46,994 --> 00:15:50,328
<i>demands that I have a good-looking woman,
that I'm with a good-looking woman.</i>

246
00:15:50,405 --> 00:15:53,203
<i>I couldn't go out with a woman
old enough to be my wife.</i>

247
00:15:53,274 --> 00:15:56,334
- O.D.!
- Ah-ha-ha!

248
00:15:56,411 --> 00:15:59,403
- Look at you and your free ass.
- What's up, man?

249
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,675
Come here, boy.
Give me a motherfuckin' hug.

250
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:04,843
- I didn't know you were coming by.
- Yeah.

251
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,853
My nigger.

252
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:09,682
Good lookin' out, man. I don't know
what to say, man. Thank you, thank you.

253
00:16:09,724 --> 00:16:11,930
- Uh-huh. Who was there for your ass, huh?
- You was there.

254
00:16:11,944 --> 00:16:13,902
- Who? Who? Who?
- You, nigger. You, nigger. You.

255
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:17,262
You goddamn right. See?
That's how that shit works.

256
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:19,822
You get your ass in trouble,
I get your ass out.

257
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:25,271
That's my motherfucking job. And I don't
mind telling you, nigger, it's steady work.

258
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:28,831
Hey, look here, man, I'm still scared
as a motherfucker, O.D.

259
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,844
They talkin' like they
serious as hell...

260
00:16:30,912 --> 00:16:32,607
givin' me time for
that machine gun shit.

261
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,382
Oh, come on, man. They're just
trying to put a fright in your ass.

262
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,120
If that's what they're doin',
they done did it.

263
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,149
- How old is that machine gun shit, huh?
- About three years.

264
00:16:41,222 --> 00:16:43,816
Three years? Come on, man,
that's a old crime, man.

265
00:16:43,891 --> 00:16:46,826
They ain't got room in the joint for all
these niggers out here killing people now.

266
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:48,828
How they gonna
find room for you?

267
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,447
That ain't what
they're telling me.

268
00:16:50,494 --> 00:16:54,959
That's why they call it "fuckin' with you". Now,
let me tell you how we're going to retaliate.

269
00:16:55,036 --> 00:16:58,995
All right? Tomorrow I'm gonna pick
you up, take you over to Century City,

270
00:16:59,073 --> 00:17:00,775
introduce you to my lawyer.

271
00:17:00,795 --> 00:17:05,603
Let me tell you something about my lawyer.
This brother's name is Stacin Goins.

272
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,614
This nigger is a junkyard dog.

273
00:17:07,682 --> 00:17:10,082
He my own personal
Johnny Cochran.

274
00:17:10,151 --> 00:17:12,585
Matter of fact,
he kicked Johnny Cochran's ass.

275
00:17:12,653 --> 00:17:16,180
And like Johnny Cochran,
this nigger hate cops. I'm serious, man.

276
00:17:16,257 --> 00:17:18,851
He live to fuck with the police.

277
00:17:18,926 --> 00:17:21,861
Now, as a favour,
I had him look at your case.

278
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:25,846
He say you ain't got shit to worry about.
They just fuckin' with you.

279
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:31,438
So we're gonna sic the junkyard dog on their
ass and make 'em stop fuckin' with you.

280
00:17:31,506 --> 00:17:33,627
- Good lookin' out, man. Good lookin' out.
- Hmm? Mm-hmm.

281
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:36,538
- Come on in. Come on, man, and let's celebrate.
- No, no. Uh-uh.

282
00:17:36,611 --> 00:17:38,573
Look here, I'm really
supposed to be somewhere.

283
00:17:38,586 --> 00:17:41,833
Matter of fact, I was kind of hoping
you could come run with me.

284
00:17:43,283 --> 00:17:45,779
What you mean?

285
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,086
You know, man,

286
00:17:47,154 --> 00:17:49,496
I hate to be the kind of nigger
that do a nigger a favour,

287
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,710
then bam... hit the nigger up
for a favour in return,

288
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,585
but I gots to be
that kind of nigger.

289
00:17:54,662 --> 00:17:58,375
- What? What you want?
- I need a favour, nigger.

290
00:17:58,448 --> 00:18:01,235
- That requires me to go out tonight?
- Just a bit.

291
00:18:01,255 --> 00:18:03,901
Aw, man, I wasn't plannin'
on goin' no place tonight.

292
00:18:03,971 --> 00:18:07,600
It is late as hell, man.
I'm home, I'm high, man. Come on.

293
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:10,269
Uh-huh.
And why are you home, huh?

294
00:18:10,344 --> 00:18:14,942
You home because I spent $10,000
to get your ass home.

295
00:18:15,008 --> 00:18:19,122
Now, look, I got a little problem,
all right?

296
00:18:19,155 --> 00:18:21,187
I need some help,
and you can help me out.

297
00:18:21,255 --> 00:18:23,855
Go in the house and throw some shit on.
Let's walk out to the car.

298
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,792
Come on.

299
00:18:28,596 --> 00:18:31,030
I'm ready, man. What's your problem?
There ain't no problem, man.

300
00:18:31,098 --> 00:18:33,032
It's more like a situation.

301
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,400
You remember them three M-60 machine guns
I sold last year outta the five I got?

302
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:40,338
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm gonna sell the other two tonight.

303
00:18:40,408 --> 00:18:45,004
There's this group of Koreans over in Korea town
startin' this little Neighbourhood Watch thing.

304
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:49,311
And they need some weapons so they can show the
neighbourhood niggers they mean business.

305
00:18:49,383 --> 00:18:53,376
Now, I'm gonna sell them the other
two machine guns, all right?

306
00:18:53,454 --> 00:18:56,787
The problem is, I ain't never done
business with these Koreans before.

307
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:59,792
I ain't worried, 'cause by and large
Asians are very dependable.

308
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,435
They don't want no trouble.

309
00:19:01,502 --> 00:19:03,989
You might argue with them
about price and shit,

310
00:19:04,065 --> 00:19:06,273
but you ain't gotta worry about
them shootin' you in the back.

311
00:19:06,293 --> 00:19:07,980
But I got me a rule.

312
00:19:07,989 --> 00:19:12,220
Never do business with people you ain't never
done business with before without backup.

313
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,167
And that's why I need you. Backup.

314
00:19:16,595 --> 00:19:20,402
Look, all you've got to do is lay in
here and hold on to this motherfucker.

315
00:19:20,448 --> 00:19:23,749
All right? I'm gonna tell 'em I'm goin'
in the trunk to show 'em the goods.

316
00:19:23,818 --> 00:19:26,984
When I open the trunk, you pop up
and rack this motherfucker.

317
00:19:27,011 --> 00:19:28,755
Man, fuck that shit.
I ain't for shootin' nobody.

318
00:19:28,823 --> 00:19:30,285
I ain't said nothin'
about you shootin' nobody.

319
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:32,985
All you gotta do is hold on to it.
They'll get the idea.

320
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,919
Man, you must be out of your mind if you
think I'm gonna get in this dirty-ass trunk.

321
00:19:36,998 --> 00:19:39,193
We ain't goin' nowhere
but to Korea town, man.

322
00:19:39,266 --> 00:19:41,359
You ain't gonna be in here
no more than ten minutes.

323
00:19:41,435 --> 00:19:45,201
I ain't ridin' in no trunk for no minute, man.
Why can't I ride up front with you?

324
00:19:45,272 --> 00:19:47,968
You can't ride up front with me.
The surprise element is 90% of it.

325
00:19:47,975 --> 00:19:51,168
I'm sorry, man, but I ain't
gettin' in no goddamn trunk.

326
00:19:52,075 --> 00:19:54,542
- I can't believe you'd do me like this.
- Do you like what, man?

327
00:19:54,615 --> 00:19:58,435
I just ain't climbing in no goddamn,
dirty-ass trunk, man.

328
00:19:58,461 --> 00:20:00,053
I got a problem
with small places.

329
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:03,215
I got a problem with spending $10,000 on ungrateful
peanut-haired niggers to get them out of jail,

330
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,407
but I did it.

331
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:06,366
And how small was that
jail cell, motherfucker?

332
00:20:06,431 --> 00:20:08,592
Look, man, I know I owe you,
you got to bring all this up.

333
00:20:08,594 --> 00:20:10,615
If you owe me, then get
your ass in this trunk.

334
00:20:10,631 --> 00:20:14,761
Man, I want to help you, but I won't be
locked in no goddamn trunk of no car.

335
00:20:14,835 --> 00:20:17,770
You think I wanted to spend
$10,000 on your ass, huh?

336
00:20:17,838 --> 00:20:20,568
- Man, I know you helped me out.
- Do you think I wanted to spend $10,000 on your ass?

337
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:23,081
- Yes or no?
- Of course you didn't, but look, in the trunk?

338
00:20:23,144 --> 00:20:26,341
That's the only way I could help you,
right? So that's what I did.

339
00:20:26,414 --> 00:20:30,009
Now, look, man, all I'm asking
you to do is get in the trunk,

340
00:20:30,084 --> 00:20:33,247
hold this fuckin' shotgun, point it at these
Buddha-heads when I open it, all right?

341
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,256
- You're catching a nigger off-guard with this shit.
- Look here. I tell you what.

342
00:20:37,324 --> 00:20:39,622
When we get through fucking
with these Koreans,

343
00:20:39,694 --> 00:20:43,430
me and you go to Roscoe's
Chicken and Waffles on me.

344
00:20:43,464 --> 00:20:45,198
Think about it now.

345
00:20:45,266 --> 00:20:48,292
That 'Scoe's Special,
smothered in gravy and onions,

346
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:51,964
side of red beans and rice,
some greens.

347
00:20:52,132 --> 00:20:54,439
That's some good eatin'.

348
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:55,979
Man.

349
00:21:01,048 --> 00:21:04,313
Exactly how long do I gotta
be in this motherfucker?

350
00:21:04,418 --> 00:21:08,377
Hey, you said ten minutes. Hey, motherfucker,
you like to hit my goddamn head!

351
00:21:08,422 --> 00:21:10,720
You pony tail-wearing
motherfucker.

352
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,704
What the hell's wrong with you?

390
00:24:58,325 --> 00:25:00,956
Okay. Okay.
I'm just hanging out with Simone.

391
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,051
Oh, yeah?
She doin' that show for you?

392
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,216
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

393
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:08,163
Yeah, I can hear the Supremes in
the background. She ain't bad, is she?

394
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,703
- No, she's pretty good.
<i>- She do Mary Wells for you yet?</i>

395
00:25:10,731 --> 00:25:14,216
Nah, I don't know the names of everybody,
but she's done a whole bunch of them.

396
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,290
Uh-huh. Well, guess where I am?

397
00:25:17,342 --> 00:25:18,528
I don't know.

398
00:25:18,605 --> 00:25:21,301
I'm in the cosy confines
of an Oldsmobile...

399
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:23,536
parked right outside
Simone's house.

400
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,923
- Oh, you're outside?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

401
00:25:25,996 --> 00:25:27,889
- Come on in.
<i>- Ah, no, no, no, man.</i>

402
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:29,741
I done already caught that show.

403
00:25:29,817 --> 00:25:33,947
I got some for-your-eyes-only shit
to show you. Why don't you step outside?

404
00:25:40,961 --> 00:25:43,874
- Who was that?
- That's Beaumont.

405
00:25:43,927 --> 00:25:45,698
Who's Beaumont?

406
00:25:45,766 --> 00:25:48,530
A employee I had to let go.

407
00:25:54,675 --> 00:25:56,435
What'd he do?

408
00:25:57,644 --> 00:26:02,206
He put hisself in a position where he was
gonna have to do ten years in prison.

409
00:26:02,282 --> 00:26:04,273
That's what he did.

410
00:26:04,351 --> 00:26:06,410
And if you know Beaumont,

411
00:26:06,487 --> 00:26:10,537
you know there ain't no goddamn way
he can do ten years.

412
00:26:10,577 --> 00:26:15,224
If you know that, then you know Beaumont's
gonna do anything Beaumont can...

413
00:26:15,295 --> 00:26:17,661
to keep from doin'
them ten years,

414
00:26:17,731 --> 00:26:21,328
includin' tellin' the federal government
any and every motherfucking thing...

415
00:26:21,361 --> 00:26:23,901
about my black ass.

416
00:26:23,971 --> 00:26:26,963
Now, that, my friend,
is a clear-cut case...

417
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:29,168
of him or me,

418
00:26:29,243 --> 00:26:31,473
and you best believe...

419
00:26:31,545 --> 00:26:33,979
it ain't gonna be me.

420
00:26:36,322 --> 00:26:37,578
Now, Louis,

421
00:26:41,422 --> 00:26:44,721
if you gonna come in
on this thing with me,

422
00:26:44,792 --> 00:26:46,760
you've got to be prepared...

423
00:26:46,827 --> 00:26:49,523
to go all the way.

424
00:26:49,596 --> 00:26:52,656
Now, I got me, so far,
a half million dollars in lock boxes...

425
00:26:52,733 --> 00:26:55,479
in a bank down
in Cabo San Lucas.

426
00:26:56,092 --> 00:26:58,337
I make this delivery,

427
00:26:58,405 --> 00:27:01,101
I'm gonna have me
over a million.

428
00:27:01,175 --> 00:27:05,771
Hey, you think I'm gonna let a little
cheese-eatin' nigger like this fuck that up?

429
00:27:05,846 --> 00:27:08,371
You best think again.

430
00:27:08,582 --> 00:27:11,384
Before I let that happen,
I'll shoot this nigger in the head...

431
00:27:11,452 --> 00:27:13,313
and ten niggers
look just like him.

432
00:27:13,353 --> 00:27:15,367
You understand what I'm saying?

433
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,290
Yeah.

434
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:23,557
- So we on the same page then?
- Yeah, I follow.

435
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:29,279
My nigger.

436
00:27:39,913 --> 00:27:42,677
Miss Brown!

437
00:27:42,749 --> 00:27:45,684
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus, L.A.P.D.

438
00:27:45,752 --> 00:27:49,017
- Can I ask what you have in that bag?
- The usual stuff.

439
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:51,385
You know, I'm a flight
attendant for Cabo Air.

440
00:27:51,412 --> 00:27:55,139
- Can I help out here?
- Who's this?

441
00:27:55,178 --> 00:27:58,261
Sorry, this is Special Agent Ray Nicolette
with Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

442
00:27:58,332 --> 00:28:01,859
- Oh, yeah? May I see some I.D.?
- Yeah. Sure.

443
00:28:03,837 --> 00:28:06,397
Would you mind if we just
took a look in that bag?

444
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,204
Do I mind? Do I have a choice?

445
00:28:09,276 --> 00:28:12,211
- Yeah. You have the right to say no.
- No.

446
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:14,614
And I have the right to make you wait here
with Ray while I go get a warrant.

447
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:17,261
If I don't want to go to all that trouble,
I'd just take you in on suspicion right now.

448
00:28:17,294 --> 00:28:21,794
- Suspicion of what?
- Uh, could I say something?

449
00:28:21,861 --> 00:28:24,384
He just wants to peek
inside the bag for a minute.

450
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:28,214
I'll keep my eye on him
so he doesn't take anything.

451
00:28:28,261 --> 00:28:31,122
- Go ahead.
- Thanks a lot.

452
00:28:33,374 --> 00:28:35,374
Bad knees.

453
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,100
You have a good flight?

454
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:42,069
It's a shitty flight down to Cabo. I went
down there one time with Susan, my wife.

455
00:28:42,242 --> 00:28:44,938
Fuckin' turbulence
was unbelievable.

456
00:28:47,647 --> 00:28:50,309
Hey, can I look
in this envelope?

457
00:28:53,867 --> 00:28:54,981
Ah.

458
00:29:02,394 --> 00:29:04,387
Goddamn.

459
00:29:04,421 --> 00:29:06,122
I'd say there's about, oh, uh,

460
00:29:06,193 --> 00:29:08,094
$50,000 here.

461
00:29:09,187 --> 00:29:11,201
What would you say, Ray?

462
00:29:11,271 --> 00:29:15,037
Looks like about 50,000
from here.

463
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:20,380
- Is this your money?
- What if I say no?

464
00:29:20,447 --> 00:29:23,944
You should know if you bring in anything
over 10,000, you have to declare it.

465
00:29:23,997 --> 00:29:25,370
You forget, or what?

466
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,283
You can get a $250,000 fine,
plus two years in prison.

467
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,989
You want to talk to us about this,
or do you want to talk to Customs?

468
00:29:35,062 --> 00:29:37,394
- I'm not sayin' another word.
- Jackie...

469
00:29:37,464 --> 00:29:40,297
I hope you don't mind
if I call you Jackie.

470
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:44,201
Those guys down in Customs? They're a
bunch of pricks. Excuse me, but they are.

471
00:29:44,271 --> 00:29:49,044
There's something about that job makes those
people really hard to get along with. Now...

472
00:29:49,084 --> 00:29:51,144
You can go down and talk
with those guys...

473
00:29:51,184 --> 00:29:54,811
who are really suspicious and just
really disagreeable human beings,

474
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:58,498
or you can talk with a couple of
good-hearted guys like Mark and myself.

475
00:30:01,421 --> 00:30:03,355
It's up to you.

476
00:30:05,826 --> 00:30:09,762
So let's take a look here
at the file on Jacqueline Brown.

477
00:30:10,032 --> 00:30:13,561
According to this, this isn't the
first time you've run afoul of the law.

478
00:30:13,634 --> 00:30:16,831
In 1985, while
a stewardess for Delta,

479
00:30:16,903 --> 00:30:19,267
you were busted while
carrying drugs for a pilot?

480
00:30:19,314 --> 00:30:21,534
That pilot was my husband,
and I got off.

481
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,077
You mean they offered you a deal,
and you grabbed it.

482
00:30:24,117 --> 00:30:26,337
He did time, you did probation.

483
00:30:28,248 --> 00:30:31,308
I didn't hear you ask permission
to smoke in my office.

484
00:30:31,385 --> 00:30:33,785
- May I smoke?
- No, you may not.

485
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:36,107
So you get off
with a slap on the wrist,

486
00:30:36,142 --> 00:30:39,494
but all this criminal activity fucks up
your shit for good with the big airlines.

487
00:30:41,074 --> 00:30:44,894
Cut to 13 years later,
you're 44 years of age, you're

488
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:49,132
flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fuckin
'piece of shit Mexican airline that there is,

489
00:30:49,202 --> 00:30:51,693
where you make what...
$13,000 a year?

490
00:30:51,772 --> 00:30:54,639
I make 16,000, plus benefits.

491
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:58,872
You been in the service industry 19 years,
and all you make is 16,000, plus benefits?

492
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:02,351
Didn't exactly set the world
on fire, did you, Jackie?

493
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,962
Jackie, you have a good lawyer?

494
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:08,411
Can she afford a good one, is more like it.

495
00:31:08,488 --> 00:31:10,201
Otherwise you'll be
in Sybil Brand three weeks...

496
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:12,908
before the public defender
gets around to ya.

497
00:31:16,454 --> 00:31:20,496
Hey, Jackie, do you know a guy
named Beaumont Livingston?

498
00:31:20,887 --> 00:31:23,100
Yeah? No?

499
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,204
Because he knows you.

500
00:31:26,273 --> 00:31:28,264
Well, he knew you.

501
00:31:28,632 --> 00:31:31,004
He doesn't know anybody now.
He's dead.

502
00:31:31,926 --> 00:31:34,172
They found him in a trunk
of a car this morning,

503
00:31:34,247 --> 00:31:36,408
shot, twice.

504
00:31:36,483 --> 00:31:40,214
Once in the chest,
once in the head.

505
00:31:40,633 --> 00:31:43,727
Here you go.
So I guess I'm wondering.

506
00:31:44,209 --> 00:31:46,643
If you don't know Beaumont,

507
00:31:47,728 --> 00:31:51,687
why do you suppose Beaumont
knows you?

508
00:31:55,954 --> 00:31:58,914
Look, Miss Brown, we don't
give a fuck about you.

509
00:31:59,894 --> 00:32:01,407
You know who we want.

510
00:32:01,475 --> 00:32:05,148
If you cooperate, tell us what we want
to know, we'll help you get out of this.

511
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:09,594
If you refuse to cooperate, continue to cop
a shit attitude like you're doing now,

512
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:12,409
we will give you to Customs
and they will take you to court.

513
00:32:12,486 --> 00:32:15,011
With your prior, the judge
will give you two years.

514
00:32:15,941 --> 00:32:18,649
Now, you'll probably only end up
serving a year and some change,

515
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,660
but if I was
a 44-year-old black woman...

516
00:32:21,728 --> 00:32:26,256
desperately clinging on to this one shitty,
little job I was fortunate enough to get,

517
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:29,302
I don't think that I'd think
I had a year to throw away.

518
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,930
So let's start again now,
shall we?

519
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,099
Who in Mexico gave you this money, and
who in America were you bringing it to?

520
00:32:37,144 --> 00:32:39,685
I'm not sayin'
another goddamn word.

521
00:32:47,387 --> 00:32:52,654
I'd like your permission to look through this again
so we'll know exactly how much we're talking about.

522
00:32:52,726 --> 00:32:55,490
Sure. Go ahead.

523
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:01,491
While we're at it,
let's see what else is in there.

524
00:33:01,507 --> 00:33:03,475
Do you mind?

525
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,727
Beauty case.

526
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,313
- Mm-hmm. What's in it?
- Beauty products.

527
00:33:14,373 --> 00:33:15,842
Alarm clock.

528
00:33:16,681 --> 00:33:18,945
Glass case.

529
00:33:19,505 --> 00:33:21,439
Birth control.

530
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:27,330
- What's that?
- My diet shit.

531
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,628
Let's see what else is in there.

532
00:33:31,097 --> 00:33:33,463
Here. Here. Here.

533
00:33:35,688 --> 00:33:39,114
- What's this?
- What's that shit?

534
00:33:40,734 --> 00:33:43,047
Let's go, ladies. Get in.
First door on the left.

535
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:47,439
<i>♪ Ninety-nine years
Is a long, long, long time ♪</i>

536
00:33:47,514 --> 00:33:52,042
<i>♪ Ninety-nine years

537
00:33:52,118 --> 00:33:56,316
<i>♪ Ninety-nine years

00:33:56,389 --> 00:33:58,653

541
00:34:07,353 --> 00:34:12,052
Brown, case 70032.

542
00:34:14,706 --> 00:34:16,567
The charge is...

543
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:20,139
possession of narcotics
with the intent to distribute.

544
00:34:20,213 --> 00:34:24,445
- How does your client plead?
- Uh, Your Honour, she wishes to stand mute.

545
00:34:24,811 --> 00:34:26,745
Very well.

546
00:34:26,759 --> 00:34:29,592
Detective... Varga.

547
00:34:30,002 --> 00:34:32,381
- Dargus, Your Honour.
- Sorry.

548
00:34:32,408 --> 00:34:34,661
Uh, you were the arresting officer
in this case?

549
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:37,830
- That's correct, Your Honour.
- And do you have a bail recommendation?

550
00:34:37,898 --> 00:34:40,366
- Yes, I do, Your Honour.
- And that would be?

551
00:34:40,652 --> 00:34:42,773
Based on the defendant's
prior conviction...

552
00:34:42,799 --> 00:34:46,233
and the extreme possibility of flight
due to the occupation,

553
00:34:46,266 --> 00:34:48,926
the state requests a bond
of no less than 25,000.

554
00:34:48,946 --> 00:34:51,272
You people are fine with this?

555
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,556
I'm gonna set bond at 10,000...

556
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:06,524
and set the date of August 21st...

557
00:35:06,593 --> 00:35:08,618
for the prelim.

558
00:35:08,695 --> 00:35:10,921
Your Honour, when will that be?

559
00:35:10,968 --> 00:35:14,895
That's six weeks from now, Mrs. Brown.
We'll continue this matter then.

560
00:35:15,894 --> 00:35:19,488
Owens, case 72242.

561
00:35:19,532 --> 00:35:21,481
The charge is possession
of a concealed weapon...

562
00:35:21,508 --> 00:35:24,400
and striking an officer.

563
00:35:24,477 --> 00:35:27,742
- How does your client plead?
- I thought it'd be 25.

564
00:35:29,883 --> 00:35:32,408
Uh, my client would like to
plead guilty, Your Honour.

565
00:35:32,485 --> 00:35:36,251
Is the arresting officer
here in the courtroom?

566
00:35:46,992 --> 00:35:51,156
Uh-uh-uh. I didn't hear you
wash your hands.

567
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:54,800
- Comfortable?
- Yeah.

568
00:35:54,874 --> 00:35:59,106
- Door was open, so I just come on in.
- I can see that.

569
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:01,301
- Why?
- Got some more business for you.

570
00:36:01,361 --> 00:36:03,948
Oh, yeah? What did he do?

571
00:36:04,021 --> 00:36:06,600
She is an airline stewardess.

572
00:36:06,627 --> 00:36:09,217
Got caught coming back
from Mexico with some blow.

573
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:12,281
They set her bond
this afternoon at $10,000.

574
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:16,887
Now, I'm figuring you could take
that $10,000 you owe me from Beaumont,

575
00:36:16,963 --> 00:36:18,897
move it over to the stewardess.

576
00:36:18,965 --> 00:36:22,059
- The bond for possession's only a thousand.
- Hmm. Yeah.

577
00:36:22,135 --> 00:36:26,401
Man, they fuckin' with her. They callin'
that shit "possession with intent".

578
00:36:26,473 --> 00:36:29,489
A 44-year-old black woman
caught with less than two ounces,

579
00:36:29,516 --> 00:36:31,677
they calling that shit "intent".

580
00:36:31,745 --> 00:36:35,545
The same thing happen to a movie star,
they call it "possession".

581
00:36:36,181 --> 00:36:38,301
Still sounds high.

582
00:36:38,354 --> 00:36:42,816
Well, um, she had on her,
I believe it was 50 grand in cash.

583
00:36:43,962 --> 00:36:46,188
All right, before we start
talking about stewardesses,

584
00:36:46,259 --> 00:36:48,489
let's get Beaumont
out of the way first.

585
00:36:48,561 --> 00:36:50,722
You know, I think
somebody already did.

586
00:36:51,527 --> 00:36:53,288
- What?
- You ain't hear?

587
00:36:53,366 --> 00:36:57,137
- Hear what?
- Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out.

588
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:00,272
Oh, shit. That shit rhymes.

589
00:37:00,466 --> 00:37:02,491
Blew Beaumont's brains out.

590
00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:06,443
Police make contact with you?

591
00:37:06,513 --> 00:37:10,040
Oh, hell, yeah.
First motherfucking thing they did.

592
00:37:10,116 --> 00:37:12,710
You know, they see I pay
a big money bond for my boy,

593
00:37:12,786 --> 00:37:15,721
they start thinking that "where there's
smoke there's fire" logic.

594
00:37:15,789 --> 00:37:18,745
Rousted my ass out of bed
10:00 in the morning.

595
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:20,726
Scared the shit out
of my woman Sheronda.

596
00:37:20,794 --> 00:37:23,729
She thought they was gonna
take my ass away for sure.

597
00:37:23,797 --> 00:37:27,820
- This stewardess, you know her last name?
- Mm-hmm.

598
00:37:28,514 --> 00:37:31,165
Brown. Jackie Brown.

599
00:37:31,197 --> 00:37:33,717
- What does she do for you?
- Who said she do anything for me?

600
00:37:33,807 --> 00:37:37,368
She's my friend. My friends get
in trouble, I like to help them out.

601
00:37:37,697 --> 00:37:39,722
Beaumont worked for you.

602
00:37:40,544 --> 00:37:43,197
This you and me talking,
you know, like lawyer-client thing?

603
00:37:43,276 --> 00:37:44,877
You can't tell nothing
I say to you?

604
00:37:44,924 --> 00:37:48,397
You're not my client till you
get busted and I bond you out.

605
00:37:48,427 --> 00:37:52,693
Well, we ain't got no, uh...
What you call that shit?

606
00:37:53,307 --> 00:37:54,893
Confidentiality.

607
00:37:55,074 --> 00:37:56,787
Why should I tell you anything?

608
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:59,273
'Cause you want me to know
what a slick guy you are.

609
00:37:59,293 --> 00:38:01,798
You got stewardesses
bringing you 50 grand.

610
00:38:01,868 --> 00:38:05,531
And why would a stewardess
be bringing me 50 grand?

611
00:38:05,578 --> 00:38:08,641
Now you want me to speculate
on what you do.

612
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:13,270
I'd say you were in the drug business, except
the money's moving in the wrong direction.

613
00:38:13,346 --> 00:38:18,249
Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting
away with it, so, uh, more power to you.

614
00:38:18,858 --> 00:38:20,878
All right.
You want another bond?

615
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:23,716
You want to move the 10,000 you got
on Beaumont over to the stewardess.

616
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:25,531
That means paperwork.

617
00:38:25,584 --> 00:38:28,073
I gotta get a death certificate,
present it to the court,

618
00:38:28,114 --> 00:38:31,606
make out a receipt for return of bond
collateral, I type up another application,

619
00:38:31,627 --> 00:38:34,024
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, man.
- another indemnity agreement.

620
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,242
- Jackie ain't got time for all that shit.
- I'm telling you what I have to do.

621
00:38:36,282 --> 00:38:37,957
What you have to do,
in case you forgot,

622
00:38:38,017 --> 00:38:41,444
- is come up with a premium of a thousand bucks.
- I can do that.

623
00:38:41,464 --> 00:38:44,676
You know I got the money.
I just ain't got it with me.

624
00:38:44,744 --> 00:38:48,100
Come back when you do.
I'll bond out the stewardess.

625
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:51,340
Look, you got to look at this
with a little compassion, all right?

626
00:38:51,417 --> 00:38:54,860
Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't
used to this kind of treatment.

627
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,521
Gangsters, they don't give a fuck,
but your average citizen,

628
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,712
a couple of nights in County
get to fuckin' with their mind.

629
00:38:59,759 --> 00:39:02,653
Ordell, this isn't a bar.
You don't have a tab.

630
00:39:02,682 --> 00:39:04,775
Listen to me, all right?

631
00:39:05,165 --> 00:39:09,625
You got a 44-year-old, gainfully
employed black woman falsely accused...

632
00:39:09,702 --> 00:39:13,132
Falsely accused? She didn't come
back from Mexico with cocaine on her?

633
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:15,599
Falsely accused of "intent".

634
00:39:15,909 --> 00:39:19,276
If she had that shit...
and mind you, I'm saying if...

635
00:39:19,345 --> 00:39:21,905
that was her own personal shit
to get high with.

636
00:39:21,981 --> 00:39:25,542
Is white guilt supposed to make me
forget I'm running a business?

637
00:39:28,454 --> 00:39:30,888
Oh, it's like that, huh?

638
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:37,662
All right.

639
00:39:40,366 --> 00:39:42,493
I got your little
thousand bucks.

640
00:39:46,058 --> 00:39:47,739
- Hey, Candy.
- Hey, Max.

641
00:39:47,807 --> 00:39:51,800
Dropping off Lopez, Anita.
Picking up Brown, Jackie.

642
00:39:51,878 --> 00:39:55,245
- Okay, no problem. You armed?
- You bet I am.

643
00:40:10,396 --> 00:40:13,263

You won't find
any cigarettes in there.

675
00:43:07,306 --> 00:43:11,140
- Can we stop and get cigarettes?
- Sure.

676
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:13,770
Have you ever been
to the River Bottom?

677
00:43:13,846 --> 00:43:17,839
- I don't think so.
- It's all right. It's a cop bar.

678
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:21,021
Can we just stop
at a 7-Eleven or something?

679
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:25,218
- I thought you might like to have a drink.
- I'd love to, but not there.

680
00:43:26,759 --> 00:43:28,975
How 'bout the Hilton
by the airport?

681
00:43:29,008 --> 00:43:32,961
- Is it dark?
- Kind of a sports bar.

682
00:43:33,015 --> 00:43:35,767
It doesn't sound dark.

683
00:43:36,528 --> 00:43:39,048
Why does it have to be dark?

684
00:43:39,101 --> 00:43:43,175
Because it looks like I just
got out of jail, that's why.

685
00:43:43,222 --> 00:43:46,623
Look, you're dropping me off at my place.
There's a joint near me.

686
00:43:56,456 --> 00:43:58,890
No, thanks.
I quit three years ago.

687
00:43:58,958 --> 00:44:01,586
- Gain weight?
- Ten pounds.

688
00:44:01,661 --> 00:44:04,425
Take it off and put it back on.

689
00:44:04,497 --> 00:44:08,092
That's why I don't quit.

690
00:44:11,804 --> 00:44:13,738
Mm.

691
00:44:17,143 --> 00:44:21,204
If I can't fly, I'm gonna have a bitch
of a time trying to find my rent.

692
00:44:24,417 --> 00:44:26,783
You know,

693
00:44:26,853 --> 00:44:30,550
the other day I figured out
that I must have written about...

694
00:44:30,623 --> 00:44:34,218
15,000 bonds since
I've been in the business.

695
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:38,640
I figure about 80% of those
were drug-related, so...

696
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:42,545
if you want, I could help you
figure out your options.

697
00:44:45,004 --> 00:44:47,529
So far, they told me
if I cooperate,

698
00:44:47,607 --> 00:44:51,202
then I'll get probation, maybe.

699
00:44:51,497 --> 00:44:55,024
Or if I stand mute,
I can get as much as five years.

700
00:44:55,767 --> 00:44:56,934
Does that sound right?

701
00:44:56,974 --> 00:45:00,894
I'd say that if they try you and convict you,
you won't get more than a year and a day.

702
00:45:00,934 --> 00:45:03,061
That's state time, prison.

703
00:45:03,776 --> 00:45:05,476
But they won't want to do that.

704
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:08,717
They'll offer you simple possession,
a couple of months of county time...

705
00:45:08,794 --> 00:45:11,786
and a year or two of probation.

706
00:45:11,864 --> 00:45:15,290
Do you happen to know who
put the dope in your bag?

707
00:45:15,357 --> 00:45:17,877
Yeah.

708
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:21,385
But that's not
what this is about.

709
00:45:21,413 --> 00:45:23,904
They were waiting for my ass.

710
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,013
They knew about the money.

711
00:45:26,051 --> 00:45:29,680
- They even knew the exact amount.
- What did they want to know?

712
00:45:29,721 --> 00:45:32,656
Who gave me the money
and who I was givin' it to.

713
00:45:33,827 --> 00:45:36,467
And they found this guy in the trunk
of a car with his head blown off.

714
00:45:36,494 --> 00:45:38,487
They said it was him
who told them about me.

715
00:45:38,558 --> 00:45:42,688
That would be...
Beaumont Livingston.

716
00:45:43,395 --> 00:45:45,356
How do you know about him?

717
00:45:45,431 --> 00:45:49,162
I wrote him on Monday.
They found him dead on Tuesday.

718
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:52,522

00:47:27,579 --> 00:47:28,956
Come on in.

735
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:41,076
- Do you got some booze?
- I got some vodka in the freezer.

736
00:47:41,147 --> 00:47:43,741
- Got some O.J.?
- Mm-hmm.

737
00:47:43,816 --> 00:47:46,182
Why don't you be
a good hostess and...

738
00:47:46,252 --> 00:47:49,187
hook a brother up a screwdriver?

739
00:47:49,362 --> 00:47:51,296
Sure.

740
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:59,921
Well?

741
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:03,696
- You gonna thank me?
- For what?

742
00:48:03,769 --> 00:48:06,704
Who the hell do you think
got your ass out of jail?

743
00:48:06,772 --> 00:48:10,765
The same guy that put my ass in jail.
Thanks a lot.

744
00:48:10,843 --> 00:48:15,896
Hey, you got caught with blow.
That's your business.

745
00:48:15,914 --> 00:48:18,815
- It wasn't mine.
- What?

746
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,507
Oh, shit.

747
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,552
I bet that was that present
Mr. Walker was sending Melanie.

748
00:48:25,624 --> 00:48:29,875
Yeah. If you didn't put it in there,
he must have.

749
00:48:29,915 --> 00:48:33,188
Damn. That shit wasn't called for.
Baby, I'm sorry.

750
00:48:34,134 --> 00:48:37,627
Bet they asked you a whole shitload
of questions about it, huh?

751
00:48:37,816 --> 00:48:42,019
And all that money,
where it came from.

752
00:48:42,066 --> 00:48:45,661
Probably asked you who you
was bringing' it to too.

753
00:48:47,098 --> 00:48:49,032
They asked.

754
00:48:50,255 --> 00:48:52,140
And you said?

755
00:48:52,218 --> 00:48:56,634
"I want to talk to my lawyer."

756
00:48:56,708 --> 00:49:00,685
You sure you didn't get nervous
and kind of let somethin' slip?

757
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,354
I mean, if you did,
I ain't mad at you.

758
00:49:03,429 --> 00:49:05,363
I just gotta know.

759
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,111
You ain't asking
the right questions.

760
00:49:17,702 --> 00:49:21,103
You should be asking
why they picked me up.

761
00:49:22,314 --> 00:49:25,283
They were waiting for me.

762
00:49:25,351 --> 00:49:28,946
They knew about the money
and they knew the exact amount.

763
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:33,958
They tell you how they happen
to come by this information?

764
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:35,487
Hmm.

765
00:49:36,695 --> 00:49:38,959
Beaumont Livingston?

766
00:49:39,077 --> 00:49:41,904
I knew it. I knew it.

767
00:49:42,735 --> 00:49:45,568
They even asked me
if I knew Mr. Walker.

768
00:49:45,638 --> 00:49:46,871
Yeah?

769
00:49:48,808 --> 00:49:51,094
I didn't tell them
anything about him.

770
00:49:51,811 --> 00:49:54,143
My name come up?

771
00:49:54,213 --> 00:49:56,579
Mm-mm.

772
00:49:56,649 --> 00:50:00,642
- You ain't said nothin' about me?
- Mm-mm.

773
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:03,492
Ah, that's mighty noble of you.

774
00:50:04,405 --> 00:50:09,022
They tell you what happened
to this Beaumont fellow?

775
00:50:09,094 --> 00:50:11,426
Yeah, they told me.

776
00:50:11,723 --> 00:50:13,310
Yeah.

777
00:50:13,363 --> 00:50:17,163
Somebody must have been
real mad at old Beaumont.

778
00:50:17,763 --> 00:50:21,873
Or else they pretty scared about what
he might say to keep from doing time.

779
00:50:23,476 --> 00:50:27,913
Yeah, I bet they asked you
a whole shitload of questions.

780
00:50:28,429 --> 00:50:31,916
And you ain't givin' them
no kind of answer?

781
00:50:31,984 --> 00:50:36,114
- Mm-mm.
- You scared of me?

782
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:41,717
You got any reason
to be nervous around me?

783
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:47,422
Is that what I think it is?

784
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,968
What do you think it is?

785
00:50:50,001 --> 00:50:53,571
- I think it's a gun pressed up against my dick.
- Well, you thought right.

786
00:50:53,581 --> 00:50:56,735
Now, take your hands
from around my throat,

787
00:50:56,749 --> 00:50:58,683
nigger.

788
00:51:00,285 --> 00:51:04,138
- What the hell's wrong with you, Jackie?
- Shut the fuck up and don't you move.

789
00:51:04,165 --> 00:51:06,425
Oh, what is this?
What the fuck is this?

790
00:51:06,478 --> 00:51:09,471
Hey, that ain't got nothing to do
with you. I carry that all the time.

791
00:51:09,511 --> 00:51:10,985
You been talking
to them police too much.

792
00:51:11,025 --> 00:51:13,438
- The police didn't try and strangle my ass.
- Come on, girl.

793
00:51:13,451 --> 00:51:16,593
- You know I was just playing with you.
- I ain't playing with you.

794
00:51:16,618 --> 00:51:19,918
I'm gonna unload both of these motherfuckers
if you don't do what I tell you to do.

795
00:51:19,998 --> 00:51:22,291
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Jackie, stop acting crazy.

796
00:51:22,351 --> 00:51:25,470
- Do you understand what the fuck I'm saying?
- Yeah, woman. Damn!

797
00:51:25,538 --> 00:51:27,811
Now, sit your ass down
on that sofa.

798
00:51:27,845 --> 00:51:32,603
See? Police start fuckin' with your
mind, start pittin' black against black.

799
00:51:32,678 --> 00:51:34,493
That's how they do, you know.
They been doing this since...

800
00:51:34,495 --> 00:51:36,886
Shut your raggedy ass up

801
00:51:37,016 --> 00:51:39,576
and sit the fuck down!

802
00:51:39,652 --> 00:51:42,917
And put your hands behind your head.

803
00:51:42,988 --> 00:51:47,448
- This is gettin' silly now.
- Oh, silly? You want to see some motherfuckin' silly?

804
00:51:47,526 --> 00:51:50,482
If I have to tell you to shut up
one more time, I'm gonna shut you up.

805
00:51:50,509 --> 00:51:54,959
- I just came over here to talk to you.
- To talk?

806
00:51:55,034 --> 00:51:59,037
The way I see it, you and me got one
motherfucking thing to talk about.

807
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:00,744
One thing,

808
00:52:01,931 --> 00:52:05,077
and that's what you
are wiling to do for me.

809
00:52:05,131 --> 00:52:08,641
- I can get you a lawyer.
- No, let's be realistic.

810
00:52:08,714 --> 00:52:11,717
Now, sooner or later they're gonna
get around to offering me a plea deal,

811
00:52:11,777 --> 00:52:13,711
and you know that.

812
00:52:13,757 --> 00:52:16,377
- That's why you came here to kill me.
- I ain't come over to kill you.

813
00:52:16,416 --> 00:52:18,663
No, that's all right. It's okay.

814
00:52:18,705 --> 00:52:20,257
Now, I forgive you.

815
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:24,960
Now, let's say,
if I tell on you,

816
00:52:25,026 --> 00:52:26,697
I walk.

817
00:52:26,765 --> 00:52:29,427
- If I don't, I'll go to jail.
- Uh-huh.

818
00:52:29,447 --> 00:52:32,447
I want $100,000...

819
00:52:32,504 --> 00:52:34,507
in an escrow account
in my name...

820
00:52:35,481 --> 00:52:38,487
if I'm convicted up to a year
or put on probation.

821
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,278
Now, if I have to do
more than a year,

822
00:52:41,347 --> 00:52:44,748
you pay another $100,000.

823
00:52:49,821 --> 00:52:51,647
I can do that.

824
00:52:51,724 --> 00:52:55,062
- You know I got that problem. All my money is...
- In Mexico.

825
00:52:55,102 --> 00:52:58,993
- Right.
- Well, I been thinking about that too.

826
00:52:59,064 --> 00:53:01,259
I got me an idea.

827
00:53:02,568 --> 00:53:05,298
Uh...

828
00:53:05,371 --> 00:53:06,864
Let me hear that.

829
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:08,691
We friends again.

830
00:53:08,713 --> 00:53:11,644
Why don't you point that
motherfucking gun somewhere else?

831
00:53:16,882 --> 00:53:21,080
- I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
- All right.

832
00:53:38,837 --> 00:53:41,305
You want your gun back?

833
00:53:41,373 --> 00:53:44,308
Come in and I'll get it for you.

834
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:08,895
Max, look,
I am so sorry about this.

835
00:54:08,967 --> 00:54:13,063
You know, I was afraid to ask to borrow
it, 'cause I was afraid you would say no.

836
00:54:13,138 --> 00:54:15,470
I mean, you'd have to.

837
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:18,567
Would you like some coffee?

838
00:54:18,883 --> 00:54:21,238
- If you're having some.
- I am. Come on in.

839
00:54:21,313 --> 00:54:23,804
Why don't you make
yourself at home?

840
00:54:23,882 --> 00:54:26,442
Just, you know, have a seat.

841
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:29,301
Did you get a chance to use it?

842
00:54:29,321 --> 00:54:32,154
I felt a lot safer having it.

843
00:54:32,321 --> 00:54:35,387
Oh, the milk went bad
while I was in jail.

844
00:54:35,807 --> 00:54:38,241
- Black's fine.
- Cool.

845
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:41,923
Would you, uh, care to
hang on to it for a while?

846
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,458
It wouldn't be legal, but if it
makes you feel better, I guess...

847
00:54:45,537 --> 00:54:47,971
Well, thanks. I got one now.

848
00:54:48,893 --> 00:54:50,804
You went out this morning
and bought a gun?

849
00:54:50,876 --> 00:54:54,573
- What? I didn't hear you.
- You went out this morning and bought a gun?

850
00:54:55,133 --> 00:54:58,959
Well, let's say
I got one now, okay?

851
00:54:59,024 --> 00:55:01,959
- Somebody loan it to you?
- Yeah.

852
00:55:05,817 --> 00:55:08,877
All right! We're on.

853
00:55:09,427 --> 00:55:13,261
It might be a little black.
Would you like to hear some music?

854
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:16,244
- Sure.
- Cool.

855
00:55:16,982 --> 00:55:19,138
You know, I couldn't wait
to get home last night...

856
00:55:19,179 --> 00:55:21,739
and wash the jail outta my hair.

857
00:55:23,002 --> 00:55:25,994
- It looks nice.
- Thanks.

858
00:55:27,725 --> 00:55:30,475
You never got into
the whole CD revolution?

859
00:55:30,521 --> 00:55:33,979
Oh, I got a few, but I can't afford
to start all over again.

860
00:55:34,018 --> 00:55:36,814
I mean, I've invested too much
time and money...

861
00:55:36,855 --> 00:55:38,281
in my albums.

862
00:55:38,364 --> 00:55:40,696
Yeah, but you can't get
new stuff on records.

863
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:45,647
I don't get new stuff
that often.

864
00:56:01,847 --> 00:56:05,180
<i>♪ I gave my heart and soul ♪</i>

865
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:08,549
<i>♪ To you, girl ♪</i>

866
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:12,137
<i>♪ Didn't I do it, baby ♪</i>

867
00:56:12,191 --> 00:56:15,011
<i>- ♪ Didn't I do it, baby ♪</i>
- It's pretty.

868
00:56:15,097 --> 00:56:16,827
Mm-hmm.

869
00:56:17,371 --> 00:56:21,332
- Who is this?
- The Delfonics.

870
00:56:22,371 --> 00:56:24,011
<i>- ♪ Didn't I do it, baby ♪</i>
- It's nice.

871
00:56:24,064 --> 00:56:28,384
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- ♪ Didn't I do it, baby ♪</i>

872
00:56:28,397 --> 00:56:31,857
I called in sick today. As far as
the airline knows, I'm still available.

873
00:56:31,877 --> 00:56:32,557
Are you?

874
00:56:32,577 --> 00:56:35,823
I don't know. I'm gonna go in and
talk with Nicolette and Dargus today.

875
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:39,548
I'm going to do what you suggested...
offer to help and see what happens.

876
00:56:39,589 --> 00:56:43,310
What I meant was to have a lawyer
do the negotiating for you.

877
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:46,819
No, I want to talk to them first.
I know more now about Ordell's money.

878
00:56:46,892 --> 00:56:51,022
Well, if it's the A.T.F. guy that wants you,
that'll only interest him up to a point.

879
00:56:51,096 --> 00:56:53,465
I know, but it's a lot of money.

880
00:56:53,511 --> 00:56:57,701
It's a half a million dollars
all in Cabo, and more coming in.

881
00:56:58,217 --> 00:57:01,865
- How'd you find that out?
- Ordell told me last night.

882
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:05,432
- He called?
- He came by.

883
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,173
- What'd you do?
- We talked.

884
00:57:09,954 --> 00:57:12,321
Do you think
he still trusts you?

885
00:57:12,367 --> 00:57:15,200
He had his doubts at first,
but he's always trusted me.

886
00:57:15,261 --> 00:57:19,148
And he wants to believe more than
anything else that he still can.

887
00:57:21,526 --> 00:57:23,999
- Why?
- Because he needs my ass.

888
00:57:24,072 --> 00:57:27,986
Otherwise, that money's just gonna sit
over there in Cabo. You want some sugar?

889
00:57:28,026 --> 00:57:32,397
No, thank you. There's gotta be
other ways of getting it out.

890
00:57:32,438 --> 00:57:35,637
Maybe, but I'm the only one
he's ever used.

891
00:57:35,664 --> 00:57:38,524
I mean, he can't use his other people.
They're crooks.

892
00:57:38,556 --> 00:57:41,575
I mean, he might try to...
bring the money in himself,

893
00:57:41,622 --> 00:57:44,562
but he ain't gonna wanna
stand in no customs lines.

894
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:48,055
So, either he recruits another Cabo
stewardess or he continues to trust me.

895
00:57:48,109 --> 00:57:50,529
And I made him feel
like he still can.

896
00:57:50,575 --> 00:57:53,356
Are you gonna offer
to set him up?

897
00:57:53,425 --> 00:57:56,045
Yeah, if I get off.
Otherwise, fuck 'em.

898
00:57:57,071 --> 00:58:01,105
It's very possible that
Ordell's killed somebody.

899
00:58:01,138 --> 00:58:03,714
Do you realize that?

900
00:58:03,754 --> 00:58:07,986
Well, I ain't going back to jail and I
ain't doing that probation thing again.

901
00:58:14,292 --> 00:58:16,732
Max, how do you feel
about getting old?

902
00:58:17,759 --> 00:58:20,552
You're not old. You look great.

903
00:58:22,052 --> 00:58:25,165
No, I'm asking you
how do you feel about getting old.

904
00:58:25,192 --> 00:58:29,192
- Doesn't it bother you?
- It's not really something I think about.

905
00:58:29,238 --> 00:58:33,360
- Really?
- I guess I got sensitive about my hair a few years ago.

906
00:58:33,432 --> 00:58:36,731
It started falling out,
so I did something about it.

907
00:58:37,562 --> 00:58:39,442
How'd you feel about that?

908
00:58:39,515 --> 00:58:41,988
I feel fine with it.
Otherwise, I wouldn't have done it.

909
00:58:42,028 --> 00:58:45,997
I did it to feel better about myself,
and, you know, I do.

910
00:58:46,044 --> 00:58:49,305
I look in the mirror.
Looks like me.

911
00:58:49,381 --> 00:58:51,120
Yeah, but it's
different for men.

912
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:56,191
You know, I can't really feel
too sorry for you in this department.

913
00:58:56,254 --> 00:58:58,903
I bet that,
except for possibly an afro,

914
00:58:58,957 --> 00:59:02,051
you look exactly
the way you did at 29.

915
00:59:03,595 --> 00:59:06,325
Well, my ass ain't the same.

916
00:59:06,738 --> 00:59:07,804
Bigger?

917
00:59:09,464 --> 00:59:10,925
Yeah.

918
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,520
Ain't nothing wrong with that.

919
00:59:15,353 --> 00:59:17,386
Something else worry you?

920
00:59:18,543 --> 00:59:20,023
Oh.

921
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,811
I always feel like I'm starting over.

922
00:59:26,757 --> 00:59:29,843
- How many bonds you said you wrote?
- 15,000.

923
00:59:31,343 --> 00:59:33,457
- Is that a lot?
- That's plenty.

925
00:59:35,961 --> 00:59:38,725
Well, I've flown
over seven million miles,

926
00:59:38,797 --> 00:59:42,787
and I've been waiting
on people for 20 years.

927
00:59:42,827 --> 00:59:45,661
Then after my bust, the best job
I could get was with Cabo Air,

928
00:59:45,737 --> 00:59:49,400
which is the worst job
you can get in this industry.

929
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:51,503
You know I make 16,000 a year,

930
00:59:51,536 --> 00:59:54,972
plus retirement benefits
that ain't worth a damn?

931
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:59,477
And with this arrest hanging over
my head, Max, I'm scared.

932
00:59:59,524 --> 01:00:01,790
And if I lose this job,
I gotta start all over again,

933
01:00:01,853 --> 01:00:04,117
and I ain't got nothing
to start over with.

- Fine.

01:00:28,947 --> 01:00:31,780
- Can I have a word outside with Ray for a minute?
- Sure. Take your time.

943
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:33,943
- I'll just be a minute.
- May I smoke?

01:00:34,019 --> 01:00:37,302
Absolutely.

- She wants to make a deal.

946

- Oh, yeah? Did she sound scared?
- She almost sounds scared.

01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,393
- What's she want?
- She wants to go back to work.

948

- Oh, yeah? So what's she going to give us?
- She hasn't gone into specifics.

949
01:00:47,265 --> 01:00:49,859
- She's been waiting for you to get here.
- She knows it's my case, right?

950
01:00:49,935 --> 01:00:52,062
Well, she hasn't said it,
but she's not stupid.

951
01:00:52,137 --> 01:00:55,504
- She knows it's you who wants her.
- Let's go. Cool.

952
01:00:56,942 --> 01:01:00,089
Jackie, sorry to keep you waiting.

953
01:01:00,135 --> 01:01:03,222
Now, what can we do for you?

954
01:01:03,288 --> 01:01:07,004
I need permission to leave
the country so I can keep my job.

955
01:01:07,058 --> 01:01:10,547
- Yeah, we can look into that.
- I need it tomorrow.

956
01:01:10,622 --> 01:01:13,891
If I don't show up for
work tomorrow, I'm fired.

957
01:01:13,971 --> 01:01:16,874
Well, you know what we want.

958
01:01:16,934 --> 01:01:19,232
If I'm working, I can help you.

959
01:01:19,269 --> 01:01:20,820
Help us do what, Jackie?

960
01:01:20,858 --> 01:01:24,834
- Help you get Ordell Robbie.
- So now, you do know him.

961
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,797
You never asked if I did or not.

962
01:01:26,838 --> 01:01:29,438
- So you're telling us now that you do know him.
- Of course I do.

963
01:01:29,474 --> 01:01:32,238
- I deliver money for him.
- No shit?

964
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:35,370
- You know how he makes his money?
- He sells guns.

965
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,667
- You ever see him sell a gun?
- No.

966
01:01:38,707 --> 01:01:41,183
- Then how do you know he sells guns?
- He told me.

967
01:01:41,253 --> 01:01:44,450
Besides, why else would
a A.T.F. man be after him?

968
01:01:49,361 --> 01:01:52,023
Well, how can you help us?

969
01:01:52,627 --> 01:01:56,761
I'll do anything I can to help you
get his ass, short of wearing a wire.

970
01:01:57,121 --> 01:02:00,288
And in return for my help, I need permission
to leave the country, and immunity.

971
01:02:00,324 --> 01:02:03,350
You don't want much, do you?

972
01:02:03,628 --> 01:02:05,414
Can you do it or not?

973
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,212

You know, you smoke too much of that shit,
that shit's gonna rob you of your ambition.

994
01:03:19,402 --> 01:03:20,351

01:03:21,211 --> 01:03:24,149

996
01:03:24,844 --> 01:03:26,713
No, Jackie,

997
01:03:26,791 --> 01:03:30,056
- I was gonna tell you!
- No, no, no, no, no, not on the phone.

998
01:03:30,128 --> 01:03:31,856

- Here.

999
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:34,643

- It's ready to go?

1005
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:59,319
You okay?

1006
01:04:00,543 --> 01:04:02,092
I'm just... gettin' old.

1007
01:04:04,115 --> 01:04:08,665
I can't... smoke or laugh
now without coughing.

1008
01:04:08,733 --> 01:04:11,429
Coughing's good.
It opens up the capillaries.

1009
01:04:11,503 --> 01:04:15,200
You know, when you cough, you're
pulling air... or in this case, smoke...

1010
01:04:15,273 --> 01:04:17,867
into parts of the lungs that
don't normally get used.

1011
01:04:17,942 --> 01:04:20,231
And so, coughing's good.
It gets you higher.

1012
01:04:20,285 --> 01:04:22,840
You definitely know
a lot about that.

1013
01:04:22,914 --> 01:04:25,405
Look here, Louis, I got
to run out for a little while.

1014
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:27,169
So, since you like
getting high so much,

1015
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:29,949
why don't you hang out here with Mel,
watch a little TV?

1016
01:04:29,983 --> 01:04:33,403
- Way ahead of you.
- See, I get high later on when I come back.

1017
01:04:33,443 --> 01:04:36,428
See, I get high at night when I
get through with all my business.

1018
01:04:39,568 --> 01:04:40,989
That Rutger Hauer?

1019
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:44,533
No, it's Helmut Berger.

1020
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,353
Hmm.

1021
01:04:46,391 --> 01:04:48,633
- Why don't you walk me to the door, space girl?
- Okay.

1022
01:04:51,962 --> 01:04:55,396
- You know, I hope you don't mind hanging out with Louis.
- No problem.

1023
01:04:55,456 --> 01:04:58,282
Try not to tear his clothes off of him,
all right? They're new.

1024
01:04:58,296 --> 01:05:00,511
- Ha, ha, ha!
- Ha, ha!

1025
01:05:00,585 --> 01:05:04,021
- Yo, Louis! Catch you later, man.
- Okay. Later.

1026
01:05:09,287 --> 01:05:10,834
Want a Metrix?

1027
01:05:12,263 --> 01:05:14,731
Uh... Damn. Shit.

1028
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:16,588
What's a Metrix?

1029
01:05:16,628 --> 01:05:20,475
It's like this major meal that you drink
in a shake instead of having a big meal.

1030
01:05:20,521 --> 01:05:25,121
- It's like a diet thing?
- No. It's what body builders drink to, you know, beef up.

1031
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:27,170
No, thanks.

1032
01:05:28,113 --> 01:05:30,638
Okay.

1033
01:05:33,564 --> 01:05:36,055
When was the last time
I saw you?

1034
01:05:36,113 --> 01:05:38,547
Oh... six, seven years ago.

1035
01:05:39,131 --> 01:05:41,384
It doesn't seem
like that long ago.

1036
01:05:41,424 --> 01:05:44,823
It was that long ago.

1037
01:05:47,918 --> 01:05:51,226
- How old were you in this picture?
- Which one?

1038
01:05:51,302 --> 01:05:55,071
The roller disco picture.
This one.

1039
01:05:55,091 --> 01:05:57,137
Oh. Um, 14.

1040
01:05:58,088 --> 01:06:01,269
- You were 14 here?
- Yup.

1041
01:06:01,346 --> 01:06:04,144
Shit, man.
I thought you were at least 16.

1042
01:06:05,417 --> 01:06:08,682
Well, I'm about the same height
now as I was then.

1043
01:06:09,988 --> 01:06:12,013
<i>Bruno! Sanchez!</i>

1044
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:31,580
- That other picture, that green one?
- Yeah?

1045
01:06:31,623 --> 01:06:34,091
That was taken at that place
called Flippers.

1046
01:06:34,124 --> 01:06:36,013
Do you remember that? It was in
Hollywood. Were you in L.A. then?

1047
01:06:36,073 --> 01:06:38,440
- No.
- Where were you?

1048
01:06:38,516 --> 01:06:41,076
I was in Detroit.

1049
01:06:42,045 --> 01:06:43,736
With Ordell?

1050
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:45,929
Yeah. We had done
some time already.

1051
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:49,656
Oh. Were you a... disco guy?

1052
01:06:49,743 --> 01:06:51,655
Nah.

1053
01:06:51,749 --> 01:06:56,173
- Come on. Don't lie.
- No, I wasn't. I don't like to dance.

1054
01:06:56,227 --> 01:07:00,028
- Were you ever in one?
- I went to a few just to meet women, but...

1055
01:07:00,047 --> 01:07:04,006
it was so loud
and I didn't like to dance.

1056
01:07:04,254 --> 01:07:08,171
During that whole scene,
I just drank in bars usually.

1057
01:07:08,459 --> 01:07:11,724
So who didn't make the cut?

1058
01:07:11,875 --> 01:07:15,402
- That's a picture of me in Japan.
- Whose arm is that?

1059
01:07:15,186 --> 01:07:17,862
Uh, that's the guy
that I lived with.

1060
01:07:17,929 --> 01:07:20,702
His name was Hi-Hiro...
Hiro... Hiroshi.

1061
01:07:20,722 --> 01:07:23,235
He must have made quite an impression.

1062
01:07:23,281 --> 01:07:26,876
If you count cheese.
I never got to know him really.

1063
01:07:27,398 --> 01:07:29,907
You know, I couldn't speak any Japanese,
and his English was terrible.

1064
01:07:29,927 --> 01:07:33,334
But what am I going to say? His English
was better than my Japanese, you know.

1065
01:07:34,606 --> 01:07:37,871
- That sounds like a problem.
- Not really.

1066
01:07:37,942 --> 01:07:40,368
You know, we didn't have that much
to say to each other anyway.

1067
01:07:40,418 --> 01:07:42,315
I never really got to know him,
but I knew enough to know...

1068
01:07:42,354 --> 01:07:45,118
that I wasn't missing much, so...

1069
01:07:46,031 --> 01:07:48,219
Anyway, I keep that picture because,
of all the fucking time I was there,

1070
01:07:48,252 --> 01:07:50,911
that's the only picture
I've got of me in Japan.

1071
01:07:50,989 --> 01:07:53,116
- That's Japan.
- Oh. Yeah.

1072
01:07:53,191 --> 01:07:55,682
Well... Yeah, I can...
Yeah, it looks... I could tell.

1073
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,490
Wanna fuck?

1074
01:07:58,683 --> 01:07:59,903
Yeah.

1075
01:08:15,046 --> 01:08:16,859
That was fun.

1076
01:08:17,995 --> 01:08:21,152
Yeah.
Yeah, that really hit the spot.

1077
01:08:28,019 --> 01:08:30,059
Now we can catch up.

1078
01:08:31,169 --> 01:08:32,579
Yeah.

1079
01:08:39,994 --> 01:08:41,294
You got a beer?

1080
01:08:41,325 --> 01:08:43,759
Yeah, sure. In the fridge.

- Hey.

1092
01:09:40,031 --> 01:09:44,695
Damn! I'm gonna have to remember
this place. This is all right.

1093
01:09:44,769 --> 01:09:47,533
About two minutes from your crib,
ten minutes from the gig. Not bad.

1094
01:09:47,605 --> 01:09:50,988
- What's your drink, brother?
- Let me get a screwdriver, homie.

1095
01:09:51,068 --> 01:09:52,872
- How're you doing?
- Oh, I'm fine.

1096
01:09:52,944 --> 01:09:54,781
Yes, you are.

1097
01:09:56,881 --> 01:09:59,378
Damn! I bet you come
in here on a Saturday night,

1098
01:09:59,450 --> 01:10:03,352
you need nigger repellent to keep
them motherfuckers off your ass.

1099
01:10:03,421 --> 01:10:05,930
- Oh, I do okay.
- Bullshit, Jackie.

1100
01:10:05,944 --> 01:10:10,278
You're a fine motherfucker. I bet
you do a damn sight better than okay.

1101
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:14,330
- You think anybody followed you?
- I don't think so.

1102
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:16,724
But it don't matter, 'cause they
already know I'm meeting you.

1103
01:10:16,784 --> 01:10:18,830
- How the fuck they know that?
- I told them.

1104
01:10:18,877 --> 01:10:21,070
- You told...
- 3.25.

1105
01:10:21,699 --> 01:10:23,259
- Here. Keep it.
- Thank you, sir.

1106
01:10:23,306 --> 01:10:25,919
- You told 'em? You told 'em it's me?
- They already know it's you.

1107
01:10:25,979 --> 01:10:28,179
Goddamn, that don't mean
you got to confirm it.

1108
01:10:28,232 --> 01:10:30,710
Look, the only way they're going
to give me permission to fly...

1109
01:10:30,782 --> 01:10:34,712
is if I agree to help 'em, which is
what I have to appear to be doing.

1110
01:10:34,778 --> 01:10:37,885
So I might as well give them
somebody they already know... you.

1111
01:10:37,955 --> 01:10:39,485
You tell 'em anything else?

1112
01:10:39,531 --> 01:10:43,160
Yeah, you got a half a mill in Mexico
and you want me to bring it in.

1113
01:10:43,727 --> 01:10:46,722
- Goddamn... You told them all that?
- It's true, ain't it?

1114
01:10:46,798 --> 01:10:49,507
What the fuck that got
to do with anything?

1115
01:10:49,547 --> 01:10:51,769
They know I'm
delivering for you.

1116
01:10:51,836 --> 01:10:54,532
I told 'em about the half mil.
They could give a fuck about it.

1117
01:10:54,605 --> 01:10:57,165
All they wanna do
is catch your ass with guns.

1118
01:10:57,241 --> 01:11:00,039
So I said, "Look, you want proof
he's getting paid for selling 'em?

1119
01:11:00,111 --> 01:11:02,375
- "Let me bring in the money."
- And they said?

1120
01:11:02,447 --> 01:11:05,314
Yes.

1121
01:11:05,656 --> 01:11:09,114
Hey, what's the matter? I mean,
that's what we discussed last night.

1122
01:11:10,916 --> 01:11:13,556
This is just seeming kind of risky now,
you know. Fuck this.

1123
01:11:13,589 --> 01:11:15,854
Now, let me lay it all out
to you, okay?

1124
01:11:15,927 --> 01:11:18,862
I make two deliveries...
the first with 10,000.

1125
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:22,366
You know, like a dry run?
They watch it, see how it works.

1126
01:11:22,433 --> 01:11:24,749
Then the second delivery,
I come home with the half mil.

1127
01:11:24,789 --> 01:11:27,370
Mm-mm, mm-mm.
See, that's too much exposure.

1128
01:11:27,438 --> 01:11:30,373
- Now, I ain't goin' nowhere near that money.
- You don't have to.

1129
01:11:30,441 --> 01:11:32,594
I told them you never
pick up the money yourself.

1130
01:11:32,637 --> 01:11:35,902
- You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
- Mm.

1131
01:11:36,407 --> 01:11:39,514
- That's a good idea.
- If you listen, it's a damn good idea.

1132
01:11:39,744 --> 01:11:42,397
Now, the first time I do it,
they're looking around,

1133
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:44,877
they see me hand
the 10,000 to someone.

1134
01:11:44,915 --> 01:11:47,437
- Who?
- I don't know. A friend of yours.

1135
01:11:48,706 --> 01:11:51,620
- Like a woman?
- If you want.

1136
01:11:51,696 --> 01:11:54,825
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm thinking a woman.

1137
01:11:54,871 --> 01:11:57,026
Wait a minute.
If they're gonna let you go,

1138
01:11:57,101 --> 01:12:01,027
- how come we don't bring all the cash in the first time?
- 'Cause I don't trust 'em.

1139
01:12:01,074 --> 01:12:03,361
Now, the next trip,
when I bring in the half mils,

1140
01:12:03,414 --> 01:12:06,108
it's gonna look like I'm doing
the same thing as I did before.

1141
01:12:06,177 --> 01:12:09,704
- But you don't?
- No. I hand it to someone else first.

1142
01:12:09,781 --> 01:12:12,441
Hmm.
And they follow the wrong one,

1143
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:14,376
thinking she's bringing
the money to me.

1144
01:12:14,452 --> 01:12:18,228
- That's the idea.
- So, we gonna need two women.

1145
01:12:18,228 --> 01:12:20,628
- Can you cover that?
- Yeah.

1146
01:12:20,661 --> 01:12:22,588
Yeah, I got the women covered.

1147
01:12:23,321 --> 01:12:25,068
Where are you planning
on puling this off?

1148
01:12:25,116 --> 01:12:27,641
The Dell Amo Mal,
the food court.

1149
01:12:28,211 --> 01:12:31,245
And I suppose you see
a piece of this for yourself?

1150
01:12:31,271 --> 01:12:33,218
It's my plan.
We're in this together.

1151
01:12:33,271 --> 01:12:36,104
Yeah, but it's my money
and I don't need no fuckin' partners.

1152
01:12:36,474 --> 01:12:38,454
I ain't your partner.
I'm your manager.

1153
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:42,434
And I'm managing to get your money out
of Mexico, into America, in your hands,

1154
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,700
and I'm managing to do it
all under the nose of the cops.

1155
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:47,817
So, therefore, I'm your manager,
and a manager gets 15%.

1156
01:12:47,878 --> 01:12:51,038
- No, a manager gets ten percent.
- No, that's an agent.

1157
01:12:51,098 --> 01:12:53,063
- A manager gets... No. No.
- I'm gonna give you ten.

1158
01:12:53,083 --> 01:12:56,019
A manager gets 15%,
agent gets 10.

1159
01:12:56,086 --> 01:12:57,373
I'm getting 15%, all right?

1160
01:12:57,415 --> 01:13:00,043
All I'm gonna give you is ten.

1161
01:13:00,698 --> 01:13:03,132
And the same deal as before.

1162
01:13:07,505 --> 01:13:10,599
I can do that.

1163
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:13,364
So he says, "Fuck that,"
and moves over into guns.

1164
01:13:13,451 --> 01:13:16,546
See, you can sell guns wherever there's
a demand, and nobody gives a shit.

1165
01:13:16,614 --> 01:13:19,023
He's acting like he's this
big international arms dealer...

1166
01:13:19,083 --> 01:13:23,310
when, come on, face it, the only people
he ever sold to were dopers.

1167
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:28,410
Yeah, well, he seems to be making out.

1168
01:13:28,463 --> 01:13:31,256
- Is it dead?
- Yeah.

1169
01:13:31,334 --> 01:13:33,928
Yeah, well... so far, he is.

1170
01:13:33,957 --> 01:13:36,570
But you got to admit,
he's not too bright.

1171
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:39,793
Oh... I wouldn't go
so far as to say that.

1172
01:13:40,972 --> 01:13:43,338
He moves his lips when he reads.

1173
01:13:43,407 --> 01:13:45,500
What does that tell you?

1174
01:13:45,536 --> 01:13:48,670
Let's say that he's
streetwise, you know.

1175
01:13:48,985 --> 01:13:51,796
We'll give him that.
He's still a fuck-up.

1176
01:14:04,195 --> 01:14:07,961
He killed a man who
worked for him the other day.

1177
01:14:08,032 --> 01:14:10,296
Well...

1178
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:14,864
So, what are you trying
to tell me?

1179
01:14:14,939 --> 01:14:17,203
That I should get out of here?

1180
01:14:17,275 --> 01:14:19,709
That's not what
I'm saying at al.

1181
01:14:19,777 --> 01:14:23,713
You know where he went?
He went to go meet that stewardess.

1182
01:14:25,088 --> 01:14:27,613
- Does that bother you?
- Please!

1183
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,220
Well, I don't know.
You live with him, so...

1184
01:14:32,283 --> 01:14:35,878
No, I live here.
He just drops in and out.

1185
01:14:36,366 --> 01:14:39,788
Did he tell you about that half million
he's got down in Mexico?

1186
01:14:39,864 --> 01:14:42,803
- Uh-huh.
- Of course he did. He tells anybody who's gonna listen.

1187
01:14:42,857 --> 01:14:44,570
Well, that's what him
and that stewardess are doing.

1188
01:14:44,597 --> 01:14:47,824
They're scheming on how
they can get that money over here.

1189
01:14:48,739 --> 01:14:51,333
And your point is?

1190
01:14:51,409 --> 01:14:56,244
- Let him and the stewardess get the money over here,
- Uh-huh.

1191
01:14:56,314 --> 01:14:59,579
And then just take it from them.

1192
01:15:04,841 --> 01:15:07,823
<i>♪ A man we passed

1193
01:15:07,892 --> 01:15:10,918
- Can I ask you a question?
- Oh, man.

1194
01:15:10,995 --> 01:15:13,868
You ain't gonna get serious
while we're in here chilling, is you?

1195
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:15,561
No. It's just about Melanie.

1196
01:15:15,608 --> 01:15:17,989
You know what?
I'm really sorry about that, man,

1197
01:15:18,028 --> 01:15:19,835
but I had to be somewhere
all of a sudden.

1198
01:15:19,869 --> 01:15:23,075
I figured, well, shit,
Louis ain't had no pussy for a while.

1199
01:15:23,089 --> 01:15:25,709
So I thought, let him
kick it here with Mel.

1200
01:15:28,192 --> 01:15:31,510
<i>♪ The things that you do ♪</i>

1201
01:15:31,582 --> 01:15:33,846
So, what she say?

1202
01:15:33,918 --> 01:15:36,887
She didn't have to say shit.
I know Melanie.

1203
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:40,151
That bitch is gonna be fucking you
two minutes after I'm out the door.

1204
01:15:40,224 --> 01:15:42,674
Melanie really good about
throwing a fuck a nigger's way.

1205
01:15:42,713 --> 01:15:46,479
I mean, she ain't no damn good at it,
but she likes to fuck.

1206
01:15:47,123 --> 01:15:49,832
- Oh, so she ain't your girlfriend?
- Is that what you thought?

1207
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:52,835
- No, I wasn't sure. I didn't know.
- But you fucked her anyway?

1208
01:15:52,903 --> 01:15:54,577
Well...

1209
01:15:54,611 --> 01:15:58,211
the "not your girlfriend" part
I felt more about.

1210
01:15:58,264 --> 01:16:01,544
Oh. Well, I hope you felt
appropriately guilty afterwards.

1211
01:16:01,584 --> 01:16:03,711
Afterwards, I did.

1212
01:16:08,586 --> 01:16:10,850
Oh, oh, shit.

1213
01:16:14,297 --> 01:16:17,811
But, um... But, like,
you know, what is she to you?

1214
01:16:17,857 --> 01:16:20,192
You know, she's just one of
the bitches I got set up.

1215
01:16:20,264 --> 01:16:22,357
I got Mel over in Hermosa Beach,

1216
01:16:22,397 --> 01:16:25,600
and I rent this little place for Simone
over in Compton where you're staying,

1217
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:30,106
and about four blocks away I got this young
19-year-old country girl named Sheronda.

1218
01:16:30,174 --> 01:16:32,774
I found her on the bus stop
two days out of Georgia,

1219
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:34,800
barefoot,
country as a chicken coop.

1220
01:16:34,827 --> 01:16:37,300
Took her to my place in Compton,
told her it was Hollywood.

1221
01:16:38,554 --> 01:16:41,149
- She believed you?
- Hell, yeah.

1222
01:16:41,218 --> 01:16:43,681
To her dumb country ass,
Compton is Hollywood.

1223
01:16:43,755 --> 01:16:46,087
Closest she ever been, anyway.

1224
01:16:46,223 --> 01:16:49,090
But you trust Melanie
around your business?

1225
01:16:49,393 --> 01:16:52,021
Oh!

1226
01:16:52,309 --> 01:16:55,244
She trying to play your ass
against me, ain't she?

1227
01:16:56,138 --> 01:16:57,882
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. See, I knew it.

1228
01:16:57,935 --> 01:17:02,499
I knew it. I knew it! See, you didn't
have to say nothing. I know that bitch.

1229
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:06,271
I don't understand why you keep someone around
your business and you can't even trust 'em.

1230
01:17:06,366 --> 01:17:08,739
I ain't gotta trust her.
I know her.

1231
01:17:08,813 --> 01:17:11,941
I don't know
what that means, man.

1232
01:17:12,016 --> 01:17:14,507
Well, you can't trust Melanie,

1233
01:17:14,585 --> 01:17:18,021
but you can always trust
Melanie to be Melanie.

1234
01:17:18,089 --> 01:17:21,616
Well, I don't understand
why you keep her the fuck around.

1235
01:17:21,692 --> 01:17:24,820
I told you, man.
She's my fine little surfer girl.

1236
01:17:24,895 --> 01:17:27,318
You know, she ain't pretty
as she used to be and...

1237
01:17:27,344 --> 01:17:30,432
she bitch a whole lot more
than she used to,

1238
01:17:30,501 --> 01:17:32,594
but she white.

1239
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:06,796
<i>You have one message sent at 8:06 p.m.</i>

<i>End of message.</i>

1256

Now, the money's gonna be in
a Dell Amo shopping bag, all right?

1257
01:19:11,468 --> 01:19:15,632
I get some food, sit down here in
the food court, then your girl comes in.

1258
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:17,300
- Did you find somebody yet?
- Mm-hmm.

1259
01:19:17,374 --> 01:19:19,308
- Who?
- What you care?

1260
01:19:19,376 --> 01:19:22,233
What I care is my ass
facing the penitentiary.

1261
01:19:22,267 --> 01:19:24,954
- You send some hard-headed rock whore up here and she...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1262
01:19:24,987 --> 01:19:28,773
She ain't gonna be no rock whore.
She's gonna be cool, promise.

1263
01:19:45,957 --> 01:19:48,236
- All right, so we straight, right?
- Mm-hmm.

1264
01:19:48,263 --> 01:19:51,563
Okay. I'm gonna roll up over here and
check out this shirt I was looking at.

1265
01:19:51,588 --> 01:19:55,080
- I'll catch you.
- Hey, don't forget your bags.

1266
01:20:17,534 --> 01:20:19,798
Shit!

1267
01:20:38,555 --> 01:20:39,655
Max!

1268
01:20:40,444 --> 01:20:41,607
Max!

1269
01:20:42,625 --> 01:20:44,388
Hey.

1270
01:20:46,130 --> 01:20:48,323
Well, hello.

1271
01:20:49,216 --> 01:20:51,835
- Hey, surprise.
- I walked right past you.

1272
01:20:51,935 --> 01:20:55,635
I know, ignoring me.
So, what are you up to?

1273
01:20:55,652 --> 01:20:58,485
- Just catching a movie.
- What'd you see?

1274
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:02,695
What the fuck
is up with this shit?

1275
01:21:12,789 --> 01:21:16,020
- I called you last night.
- I know. I got your message.

1276
01:21:16,065 --> 01:21:19,572
Ray wanted to have dinner with me so we can,
you know, talk about the sting we're plotting.

1277
01:21:19,630 --> 01:21:22,292
That's what he calls it,
a sting.

1278
01:21:22,366 --> 01:21:24,994
He's been...
He's been real nice.

1279
01:21:26,270 --> 01:21:28,534
You think he's got
a thing for you?

1280
01:21:29,378 --> 01:21:30,971
Maybe.

1281
01:21:31,391 --> 01:21:36,104
But I'm thinking it's something more
like he wants the money for himself.

1282
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:38,173
Has he hinted around?

1283
01:21:38,949 --> 01:21:42,009
No. He just tries to act cool.

1284
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,206
You know, I don't think there's
anything wrong with that.

1285
01:21:45,266 --> 01:21:48,412
He's just a young guy
having fun being a cop.

1286
01:21:48,459 --> 01:21:50,492
I know the type.
Trust me on this.

1287
01:21:50,561 --> 01:21:53,446
He's more interested in Ordell
than he is in the money.

1288
01:21:53,479 --> 01:21:57,128
If he does anything suspect, it'll be
cutting corners to get the conviction,

1289
01:21:57,141 --> 01:22:00,898
but he wouldn't walk off with the money:
it's evidence.

1290
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:04,240
- And what about you, Max?
- What?

1291
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:06,114
If I was in Nicolette's place?

1292
01:22:06,147 --> 01:22:09,520
No, I mean you right now,
not if you were somebody else.

1293
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:13,880
If I saw an opportunity to walk away with a
shopping bag full of money, would I take it?

1294
01:22:13,913 --> 01:22:17,844
You know where it came from. It's not
like it's somebody's life savings.

1295
01:22:17,921 --> 01:22:20,719
It wouldn't even be missed.

1296
01:22:20,791 --> 01:22:23,988
Half a million dollars
will always be missed.

1297
01:22:24,607 --> 01:22:26,859
You're avoiding
the question, Max.

1298
01:22:28,205 --> 01:22:31,470
Okay, sure, I guess
I'd be tempted,

1299
01:22:31,648 --> 01:22:34,708
especially now since I'm getting out
of the bail bond business.

1300
01:22:35,004 --> 01:22:36,870
- Why?
- A lot of reasons.

1301
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:41,570
I guess the main one would be,
uh... I'm tired of it.

1302
01:22:46,389 --> 01:22:48,482
When did you decide?

1303
01:22:49,229 --> 01:22:50,349
It's been a long time coming,

1304
01:22:50,421 --> 01:22:52,563
but I finally made up my mind.

1305
01:22:52,596 --> 01:22:55,656
I guess it was... Thursday.

1306
01:22:56,756 --> 01:22:58,423
Miss Brown?

1307
01:22:58,476 --> 01:23:02,130
- Yes?
- I'm Max Cherry, your bail bondsman.

1308
01:23:02,199 --> 01:23:04,978
The night you got me
out of jail?

1309
01:23:05,007 --> 01:23:08,172
Yeah.
I went to pick up this guy.

1310
01:23:08,225 --> 01:23:11,248
I hear he's staying
at a house, and, uh...

1311
01:23:11,295 --> 01:23:13,195
I sneak in
and I'm waiting for him...

1312
01:23:13,241 --> 01:23:17,880
Wait a minute. After we were together,
you snuck into a guy's house?

1313
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:22,499
Yeah. I went back to my office
and found out that you took my gun,

1314
01:23:22,553 --> 01:23:24,955
got another gun
and the stun gun,

1315
01:23:24,982 --> 01:23:28,538
went to this guy's house in El Monte
and waited for him to come home.

1316
01:23:28,598 --> 01:23:31,388
- What do you do when he comes home?
- Shoot him with the stun gun.

1317
01:23:31,462 --> 01:23:34,771
While he's incapacitated,
you cuff him and take him to County.

1318
01:23:34,818 --> 01:23:36,798
- You do that?
- It's my job.

1319
01:23:36,838 --> 01:23:39,560
- Did you do that that night?
- Well, the guy never came home.

1320
01:23:39,636 --> 01:23:43,629
But I'm sitting on his couch
in the dark holding my stun gun.

1321
01:23:43,707 --> 01:23:47,006
The whole house
smells of cat pee.

1322
01:23:47,337 --> 01:23:50,602
And after a couple of hours,
I think,

1323
01:23:50,730 --> 01:23:52,617
"What am I doing this?

1324
01:23:52,643 --> 01:23:55,582
"It's 19 years of this shit."

1325
01:23:55,652 --> 01:23:59,679
And I make up my mind.
That's it.

1326
01:24:01,049 --> 01:24:04,082
I'm not sure you answered
my question, Max.

1327
01:24:04,129 --> 01:24:05,224
Which one?

1328
01:24:06,009 --> 01:24:09,209
If you had the chance,
unemployed now,

1329
01:24:09,235 --> 01:24:13,249
to walk away
with a half million dollars,

1330
01:24:13,290 --> 01:24:15,035
would you take it?

1331
01:24:35,552 --> 01:24:38,090
We gotta stop meeting like this.

1332
01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:42,490
- How was your flight?
- Fine.

1333
01:24:42,523 --> 01:24:45,493
- Bet you're happy to be working again.
- Yeah.

1334
01:24:45,569 --> 01:24:48,060
This is A.T.F. Agent
Ray Nicolette.

1335
01:24:48,138 --> 01:24:50,402
Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie.

1336
01:24:50,474 --> 01:24:52,942
Money exchange, trial run.

1337
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:56,359
Time is 3:07,

1338
01:24:56,412 --> 01:24:59,240
July 1st, 1995.

1339
01:24:59,652 --> 01:25:01,807
Location is a parking
structure at LAX,

1340
01:25:01,885 --> 01:25:04,431
row F.
parking structure D.

1341
01:25:04,471 --> 01:25:06,518
- What are you doing?
- Recording all this.

1342
01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:09,425
- I thought you were going to let this one go through.
- We are. Don't worry about it.

1343
01:25:09,465 --> 01:25:11,001
Every bit of this
goes in my report.

1344
01:25:11,015 --> 01:25:14,335
The subject is carrying
a flight bag.

1345
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:18,633
I am now removing from the flight
bag a manila envelope.

1346
01:25:19,215 --> 01:25:22,795
The envelope contains currency.

1347
01:25:24,841 --> 01:25:27,105
- All the same denomination?
- Mm-hmm.

1348
01:25:27,177 --> 01:25:29,168
One-hundred-dollar bills.

1349
01:25:29,246 --> 01:25:31,862
Okay, I'm now counting it.

1350
01:25:31,895 --> 01:25:35,228
- What time do you have to be there?
- 4:30. I'm meeting a woman.

1351
01:25:36,787 --> 01:25:39,662
- What's her name?
- He wouldn't say.

1352
01:25:39,716 --> 01:25:42,983
- You gonna follow her?
- When she leaves, somebody'll be on her.

1353
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:45,895
- You're not gonna stop her?
- No, not this time.

1354
01:25:45,909 --> 01:25:49,802
The total amount of cash...

1355
01:25:49,842 --> 01:25:54,230
in the manila envelope
is $10,000, right?

1356
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:59,107
- The subject is delivering the currency in a...
- Oh.

1357
01:25:59,161 --> 01:26:01,194
Dell Amo Fashion Centre bag.

1358
01:26:01,241 --> 01:26:03,840
Dell Amo Fashion Centre bag.

1359
01:26:03,914 --> 01:26:07,611
- The bag is, uh... purple...
- It's white.

1360
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:10,324
- White.
- It's white.

1361
01:26:10,344 --> 01:26:11,430
- Fine, the bag's white...
- With pink lettering.

1362
01:26:11,475 --> 01:26:13,409
- Purp...
- Image is purple.

1363
01:26:13,450 --> 01:26:15,364
- Lettering's pink.
- Fine...

1364
01:26:15,392 --> 01:26:18,192
Okay, the bag's white. It's got purple
on it, and the lettering's pink.

1365
01:26:18,595 --> 01:26:21,223
- Right.
- And a really good-looking woman on the cover.

1366
01:26:21,298 --> 01:26:23,232
Okay. There you go.

1367
01:27:13,517 --> 01:27:15,003
This seat taken?

1368
01:27:16,626 --> 01:27:17,852
No. Have a seat.

1369
01:27:24,428 --> 01:27:27,158
- You're hungry.
- Yes'm.

1370
01:27:28,765 --> 01:27:32,360
Put the bag on the floor, okay?
Under the table, next to mine.

1371
01:27:38,955 --> 01:27:41,168
And then when I leave...
Well, you know.

1372
01:27:44,334 --> 01:27:46,302
So, what's your name?

1373
01:27:47,711 --> 01:27:49,297
Sheronda.

1374
01:27:49,366 --> 01:27:51,891
Sheronda, that's a nice name.

1375
01:27:54,531 --> 01:27:57,329
Sheronda, go ahead. You can eat.

1376
01:28:06,870 --> 01:28:10,776
Well, Sheronda,
it was nice talking to you.

1377
01:28:27,923 --> 01:28:32,087
All right. I'll be back.
I'll check the bag. Stay here.

1378
01:28:36,112 --> 01:28:39,679
Max, you said it yourself.
Ray wants Ordell.

1379
01:28:39,719 --> 01:28:41,992
He doesn't give a shit
about the money.

1380
01:28:42,019 --> 01:28:44,737
The money won't convict him.
Guns will.

1381
01:28:45,648 --> 01:28:47,328
You're rationalizing.

1382
01:28:47,374 --> 01:28:50,304
Well, that's what you do to go
through with the shit you start.

1383
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:52,314
You rationalize.

1384
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:55,874
<i>I can do it, Max. I know I can.</i>

1385
01:28:56,132 --> 01:28:59,158
<i>I just can't do it without you.</i>

1386
01:29:10,867 --> 01:29:13,131
It's cool.

1387
01:29:18,208 --> 01:29:22,269
Excuse me, baby.
Uh, do you know what time it is?

1388
01:29:22,525 --> 01:29:25,078
- No, ma'am. I ain't got no watch.
- Oh. Hmm.

1389
01:31:06,229 --> 01:31:08,777
It could work.

1390
01:31:08,852 --> 01:31:11,548
If she handles the cops right,

1391
01:31:12,047 --> 01:31:13,680
it could work.

1392
01:31:14,947 --> 01:31:18,121
<i>♪ I gave my heart and soul ♪</i>

1393
01:31:18,194 --> 01:31:21,425
<i>♪ To you, girl ♪</i>

1394
01:31:21,498 --> 01:31:24,956
<i>♪ Didn't I do it, baby ♪</i>

1395
01:31:25,035 --> 01:31:28,436
<i>♪ Didn't I do it, baby ♪</i>

1396
01:31:32,975 --> 01:31:34,207
<i>What?</i>

1397
01:31:34,902 --> 01:31:36,102
Jackie Brown.

1398
01:31:39,616 --> 01:31:41,722
It ain't like I'm asking you
to go somewhere and spend the night.

1399
01:31:41,765 --> 01:31:45,116
I just want you to go out for
a little while while I work this deal.

1400
01:31:45,135 --> 01:31:46,956
So now you're going to pout!

1401
01:31:47,010 --> 01:31:49,850
Now it's going to take her 20 minutes
to find her purse, look for her sandals,

1402
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:52,343
find her sunglasses,
get outta here.

1403
01:31:52,408 --> 01:31:54,433
Jackie, Louis. Louis, Jackie.

1404
01:31:54,478 --> 01:31:56,197
That chick you saw stomping
around the back there,

1405
01:31:56,233 --> 01:31:58,264
that's Melanie
who about to leave!

1406
01:32:00,610 --> 01:32:03,710
Have a good time in there, baby.
Don't burn now.

1407
01:32:03,786 --> 01:32:07,119
- Want a drink?
- No. I want to talk to you now, outside. Now.

1408
01:32:07,143 --> 01:32:10,366
Mm. Let's step into my office.

1409
01:32:10,385 --> 01:32:12,649
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

1410
01:32:12,668 --> 01:32:16,729
<i>The day I follow Audrey Hill Clayton...</i>

1411
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:19,558
- What's up?
<i>- ...that day, I cut my throat.</i>

1412
01:32:19,589 --> 01:32:21,778
You got that we do it the way
I laid out, or we don't do it at al!

1413
01:32:21,798 --> 01:32:23,184
- What the hell you talkin' about?
- What the hell I'm talkin' about?

1414
01:32:23,218 --> 01:32:26,244
- Sheronda passed the money on to somebody else.
- How do you know she did that?

1415
01:32:26,304 --> 01:32:28,464
- I was there! I saw it!
- You weren't supposed to be there.

1416
01:32:28,471 --> 01:32:29,171
I hoped I was...

1417
01:32:29,197 --> 01:32:31,257
- I knew you would try to pull some shit like that!
- Hold on! Hold on, baby!

1418
01:32:31,297 --> 01:32:33,431
- I ain't puling no shit!
- What do you call it, then?

1419
01:32:33,503 --> 01:32:35,317
It's my goddamn money! I can do
what the fuck I wanna do with it.

1420
01:32:35,324 --> 01:32:35,864
I don't give a shit.

1421
01:32:35,905 --> 01:32:37,865
With my ass on the line,
oh, no, you fuckin' don't!

1422
01:32:37,891 --> 01:32:40,471
- So if we don't do it my way, then fuck it!
- Hold on. Jackie, Jackie, Jackie!

1423
01:32:40,543 --> 01:32:42,636
- Now chill! Chill!
- Oh, no! Chill, my ass! No!

1424
01:32:42,712 --> 01:32:46,232
Listen! Listen!
The woman you saw was my friend Simone.

1425
01:32:46,292 --> 01:32:47,625
She's the one gonna be
receiving the money.

1426
01:32:47,692 --> 01:32:50,778
I think she oughta see how the shit
go down. She's a nice woman.

1427
01:32:50,812 --> 01:32:55,412
You'll like her. Matter of fact, she's
on her way over here right now. Hold on.

1428
01:32:55,465 --> 01:32:57,745
Louis, call Simone.
Tell her to get her ass over here.

1429
01:32:57,751 --> 01:33:00,098
We waiting on her.

1430
01:33:00,257 --> 01:33:03,818
- Damn! That what you're pissed off about?
- Oh, just a little pissed?

1431
01:33:03,867 --> 01:33:06,734
Mm, mm, mm. I'm sorry.

1432
01:33:06,929 --> 01:33:11,195
I'm about ready for a refill. Are you
sure I can't tempt you a little bit more?

1433
01:33:11,436 --> 01:33:13,939
- Come on.
- Okay, fine. Yeah.

1434
01:33:14,142 --> 01:33:16,736
You better give me
something strong.

1435
01:33:18,555 --> 01:33:22,375
Now, Nicolette and Dargus are gonna stop
me at the airport and mark your bills.

1436
01:33:22,421 --> 01:33:24,381
I don't like that part.

1437
01:33:24,415 --> 01:33:26,321
It washes off!

1438
01:33:26,375 --> 01:33:30,328
I tell 'em we do the same thing
as before, and they'll follow Sheronda.

1439
01:33:32,721 --> 01:33:36,248
Yo, Louis. Louis?
She ain't there?

1440
01:33:36,479 --> 01:33:38,875
- Yo! No answer?
- Hmm?

1441
01:33:38,902 --> 01:33:41,782
Now, you gotta listen to this, man,
'cause this concerns you, all right?

1442
01:33:43,779 --> 01:33:46,043
- Lou!
- Hmm?

1443
01:33:48,159 --> 01:33:52,692
Okay, now, this time you're going to
get Sheronda a Billingsley bag, right?

1444
01:33:52,745 --> 01:33:55,411
Right.
The same one Simone gives me, okay?

1445
01:33:55,451 --> 01:33:59,264
Now, Simone and I make the switch in
Billingsley. She knows what I look like, right?

1446
01:33:59,338 --> 01:34:01,052
She's seen you
with Sheronda, remember?

1447
01:34:01,124 --> 01:34:03,497
All right. Now, Simone's gonna meet you
in the dress department, right?

1448
01:34:03,544 --> 01:34:07,137
- Right. Designer clothes.
- Right, right, right, right. The place y'all try shit on.

1449
01:34:07,177 --> 01:34:09,558
It's a fitting room. Big sign
over the door. You can't miss it.

1450
01:34:09,632 --> 01:34:12,032
Uh...

1451
01:34:12,758 --> 01:34:14,605
Why over there?

1452
01:34:14,645 --> 01:34:17,168
Because they're gonna be
watching my ass hard.

1453
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:19,643
That's why we can't take the risk
in doing it out in the open...

1454
01:34:19,709 --> 01:34:21,676
or even in the dining area.

1455
01:34:21,716 --> 01:34:24,705
That's why we got to do it
in the fitting room with a woman.

1456
01:34:25,049 --> 01:34:27,375
Okay.
Now, you're going to take...

1457
01:34:27,450 --> 01:34:30,214
the Billingsley bag Simone gives you
and give it to Sheronda.

1458
01:34:30,286 --> 01:34:32,447
- Right.
- And Simone gon' to wait.

1459
01:34:32,522 --> 01:34:34,785
Then she's going to peep out
the dressing room, wait on you

1460
01:34:34,805 --> 01:34:36,838
to give her the sign
there ain't nobody watching.

1461
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:40,085
She's going to leave the store,
get in the car, mission accomplished.

1462
01:34:40,109 --> 01:34:42,168
Hey! See?

1463
01:34:42,191 --> 01:34:43,818
So, what are you going
to be doing during all this?

1464
01:34:43,831 --> 01:34:47,211
Now that you got 'em watching my ass, I'm
gonna be in a titty bar waiting on Louis...

1465
01:34:47,244 --> 01:34:49,843
to call me and tell me
everything's cool.

1466
01:34:52,308 --> 01:34:55,141
I got to go! Hey!

1467
01:34:57,747 --> 01:35:01,740
- Damn! Who's wantin' to page you like that?
- It's Ray, the A.T.F. guy.

1468
01:35:01,818 --> 01:35:05,254
See, that shit work my nerves, you and that
motherfucker being so buddy-buddy.

1469
01:35:05,321 --> 01:35:08,757
Hey, if I wasn't so buddy-buddy with
that motherfucker, this wouldn't work.

1470
01:35:10,633 --> 01:35:13,864
Ordell has a guy
working for him named Louis.

1471
01:35:16,025 --> 01:35:20,096
- You two meet?
- Yeah, this afternoon before I came here.

1472
01:35:20,170 --> 01:35:23,251
He was at Ordell's apartment
in Hermosa Beach. Yeah.

1473
01:35:23,298 --> 01:35:25,778
I don't know if he lives there,
but I can find out.

1474
01:35:25,798 --> 01:35:28,038
- Did you talk to him?
- Not really. Mm-mm.

1475
01:35:28,058 --> 01:35:32,538
His full name's Louis Gara.
Just did four years up in Susanville.

1476
01:35:32,615 --> 01:35:35,478
- For what?
- Bank robbery.

1477
01:35:35,538 --> 01:35:39,858
We've been following him.
He definitely works for Ordell.

1478
01:35:39,904 --> 01:35:42,454
They did two years together about,
I don't know,

1479
01:35:42,525 --> 01:35:45,941
20 years ago or so
over at Huntsville.

1480
01:35:46,928 --> 01:35:48,628
He's not living over
in Hermosa Beach, though.

1481
01:35:48,681 --> 01:35:51,468
Ordell's got him staying
down in Compton.

1482
01:35:51,527 --> 01:35:54,860
Living with some 56-year-old
petty thief, some woman named, uh...

1483
01:35:56,219 --> 01:35:58,244
Hawkins, Simone Hawkins.

1484
01:35:58,474 --> 01:35:59,945
Hmm.

1485
01:35:59,989 --> 01:36:01,957
- You know her?
- No.

1486
01:36:02,344 --> 01:36:05,012
- They ever talk about her?
- Not yet.

1487
01:36:07,883 --> 01:36:09,783
Okay, who's the other one?

1488
01:36:09,838 --> 01:36:12,917
Some white chick named Melanie,
another girlfriend of Ordell's.

1489
01:36:12,948 --> 01:36:15,397
- What's her deal?
- It was her coke I got busted with.

1490
01:36:15,418 --> 01:36:17,517
- Oh, yeah?
- She knows everything. She's not a part of it,

1491
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:20,043
and she's pissed off
that she's not a part of it.

1492
01:36:20,063 --> 01:36:23,103
Well, this is definitely
somebody I wanna meet.

1493
01:36:23,136 --> 01:36:25,596
Okay, are we all set up for tomorrow?
Everything okay?

1494
01:36:25,663 --> 01:36:27,876
Everything's the same,
except for one change.

1495
01:36:27,930 --> 01:36:31,563
- I told him Ordell's changing the amount he's bringing in.
- Think they bought it?

1496
01:36:31,616 --> 01:36:34,910
Mm, oh, yeah. I got 'em thinking
that Ordell's real nervous,

1497
01:36:34,930 --> 01:36:37,243
and they love thinking
that he's scared of 'em.

1498
01:36:37,256 --> 01:36:42,041
You know, a good cop will never let you
know that he knows you're full of shit.

1499
01:36:42,756 --> 01:36:45,053
All he needed was
a reasonable explanation.

1500
01:36:45,121 --> 01:36:47,742
Everything's the same,
except for one change.

1501
01:36:47,789 --> 01:36:48,858
What's that?

1502
01:36:48,892 --> 01:36:51,905
Ordell feels way too hot
for him to bring in his money,

1503
01:36:51,958 --> 01:36:54,538
and he knows you're watching him
and he's fucking paranoid.

1504
01:36:54,565 --> 01:36:57,464
- So he's sweating a little bit.
- He's gonna keep his half mil where it is,

1505
01:36:57,498 --> 01:37:00,211
but he's gonna bring in 50,000
just in case he needs bail.

1506
01:37:00,245 --> 01:37:03,785
- It'll be more than that.
- Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.

1507
01:37:03,845 --> 01:37:05,698
You still have to show him
the money at the airport.

1508
01:37:05,725 --> 01:37:09,071
I'm not gonna show him the whole amount.
He'll see 50,000.

1509
01:37:09,131 --> 01:37:11,861
- And where's the rest of it?
- In the bag, underneath.

1510
01:37:11,894 --> 01:37:14,381
- What if he checks?
- He won't. He didn't before.

1511
01:37:14,429 --> 01:37:18,263
He's expecting to see 50,000,
and there it is, on top.

1512
01:37:20,102 --> 01:37:22,916
- You're taking a hell of a chance, kid.
- Not really.

1513
01:37:22,992 --> 01:37:25,535
If he finds it, I'll say
Mr. Walker put it in there...

1514
01:37:25,562 --> 01:37:28,822
and I didn't know anything about it,
like the coke.

1515
01:37:28,855 --> 01:37:31,088
- Well, then you're out. You get nothing.
- Yeah, but I'm not in jail...

1516
01:37:31,128 --> 01:37:32,388
and at least I tried.

1517
01:37:32,415 --> 01:37:34,841
You're going to have
surveillance all over you.

1518
01:37:37,293 --> 01:37:40,694
That's why you don't make a move
until I come out of that fitting room.

1519
01:37:40,736 --> 01:37:44,206
- Wearing a dress.
- Well, a suit. There's this one I had my eye on.

1520
01:37:44,259 --> 01:37:45,693
You know, it's like...

1521
01:37:46,015 --> 01:37:47,949
Excuse me.

1522
01:37:51,566 --> 01:37:52,454
Hello?

1523
01:37:52,522 --> 01:37:54,659
Look here, we got
a little change in plans.

1524
01:37:54,692 --> 01:37:56,706
No, no, no, no,
it ain't no thing. You know.

1525
01:37:56,732 --> 01:37:59,395
Everything's the same,
except one little difference.

1526
01:37:59,449 --> 01:38:01,409
You know that bitch Simone
you saw in the mall?

1527
01:38:01,449 --> 01:38:04,389
Well, she wasn't here today
'cause she done split on my ass.

1528
01:38:04,467 --> 01:38:07,231
Yeah. Me and Louis went by her pad.
She gone.

1529
01:38:07,303 --> 01:38:11,330
She gone, her shit's gone and my
10,000 motherfucking dollars is gone.

1530
01:38:11,387 --> 01:38:13,289
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't start buggin' on me.

1531
01:38:13,349 --> 01:38:15,169
Goddamn it, I'm telling you,
ain't nothing different.

1532
01:38:15,196 --> 01:38:17,222
Everything's just like
we discussed.

1533
01:38:17,242 --> 01:38:20,346
Now, except for this time
when we make the split,

1534
01:38:20,416 --> 01:38:22,441
instead of Simone
it's gonna be Melanie.

1535
01:38:22,518 --> 01:38:23,858
<i>I think someone's knocking
on the door.</i>

1536
01:38:23,902 --> 01:38:26,278
Goddamn it, Melanie got
just as much sense as that bitch has,

1537
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:28,619
she'd be in the same
fuckin' place, all right?

1538
01:38:29,559 --> 01:38:32,426
All right. Yeah, later.

1539
01:38:32,495 --> 01:38:35,555
<i>Yeah? Well, I'm gonna open it.</i>

1540
01:38:35,631 --> 01:38:38,725
<i>I hope he's a good sailor.</i>

1541
01:38:41,938 --> 01:38:44,099
Chicken shit.

1542
01:39:41,423 --> 01:39:44,862
Okay, the envelope contains $50,000.

1543
01:39:44,934 --> 01:39:48,028
I've counted it,
and I'm now marking the bills...

1544
01:39:48,104 --> 01:39:52,666
in the upper left-hand corner in the
second zero with a green felt-tip pen.

1545
01:39:55,057 --> 01:39:57,218
Ever been tempted?

1546
01:40:00,849 --> 01:40:03,409
What?
Put one of these in my pocket?

1547
01:40:03,686 --> 01:40:04,963
Mm-hmm.

1548
01:40:08,604 --> 01:40:10,910
If I did, I'd have to give
one to you, wouldn't I?

1549
01:40:11,697 --> 01:40:14,050
Of course, nobody knows
how much there is.

1550
01:40:14,103 --> 01:40:18,056
I guess we could take as much
as we want. Isn't that right?

1551
01:40:19,108 --> 01:40:21,635
Yes. All those things are true.

1552
01:40:22,881 --> 01:40:25,970
I mean, it's not like
the money belongs to anybody.

1553
01:40:26,329 --> 01:40:29,321
- That would be one point of view.
- Yeah.

1554
01:40:30,552 --> 01:40:33,487
Except it's not a point of view
shared by the A.T.F.

1555
01:40:34,797 --> 01:40:38,324
Once we make this evidence,
it belongs to us.

1556
01:40:40,054 --> 01:40:42,123
You're officially out of trouble now.

1557
01:40:42,487 --> 01:40:44,284
Don't go doing something stupid.

1558
01:40:44,287 --> 01:40:48,171
How can I do anything stupid
when I'm being watched every second?

1559
01:40:48,197 --> 01:40:50,177
You know,
I'm glad you pointed that out,

1560
01:40:50,264 --> 01:40:53,364
'cause it saves me the trouble
of pointing it out to you.

1561
01:40:53,404 --> 01:40:56,696
Now, look. Here's the deal.

1562
01:40:56,772 --> 01:40:59,434
I want you to take
all this cash.

1563
01:40:59,509 --> 01:41:02,765
I want you to put it in this
Billingsley shopping bag.

1564
01:41:02,785 --> 01:41:05,074
And that is exactly
what I expect to see...

1565
01:41:05,141 --> 01:41:08,978
when I look inside Sheronda's
Billingsley shopping bag.

1566
01:41:09,051 --> 01:41:10,985
Comprende?

1567
01:41:11,053 --> 01:41:13,929
- Si, comprende.
- Cool.

1568
01:41:13,963 --> 01:41:16,856
Hey, there's only three reasons
you couldn't make your court appearance.

1569
01:41:16,926 --> 01:41:21,652
One, you in a hospital. Two, you in jail.
Three, your ass is dead.

1570
01:41:21,686 --> 01:41:24,252
- That means you're not my friend, man. Why're you putting...
- Winston!

1571
01:41:24,292 --> 01:41:27,335
- Wait. Hold on a second. Wait a minute.
- I'm gonna be gone a few hours.

1572
01:41:27,403 --> 01:41:31,430
- Where you going?
- Dell Amo Mall. Catch a movie, maybe somethin' to eat.

1573
01:41:31,507 --> 01:41:34,600
- What you gonna see?
- Something that starts soon and looks good.

1574
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:35,986
Cool. Have fun.

1575
01:41:36,020 --> 01:41:39,341

- Hi. Can I help you?
- Yeah.

1626
01:44:57,580 --> 01:45:00,708
Um, I think I like that suit.
I'd like to try it on.

1627
01:45:05,888 --> 01:45:08,390
Wow! You look really cool.

1628
01:45:08,430 --> 01:45:11,883
- Hey, it looks cool on me too.
- It looks great.

1629
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:15,036
I mean, you wear that suit to a business
meeting, and you'll be the badass in the room.

1630
01:45:15,069 --> 01:45:17,402
Yeah? I think I like it.
I'll take it.

1631
01:45:17,409 --> 01:45:19,936
- I'm in a hurry. Can you ring it up for me?
- Cash or charge?

1632
01:45:19,941 --> 01:45:22,034
Cash.

1633
01:45:44,119 --> 01:45:46,894
- Melanie?
- Jackie?

1634
01:45:46,934 --> 01:45:48,262
Hey, girl, what's up?

1635
01:45:48,330 --> 01:45:51,595
- Hey, are you getting that suit?
- Yeah. You like it?

1636
01:45:51,667 --> 01:45:55,983
- It looks really good on you.
- You got something for me?

1637
01:45:56,057 --> 01:45:57,670
You betcha.

1638
01:46:13,255 --> 01:46:16,418
I put a cherry on top. Boo-yah!

1639
01:46:16,492 --> 01:46:20,019
What the fuck did Ordell
ever do for us, huh?

1640
01:46:20,095 --> 01:46:22,529
Thanks.

1641
01:47:23,926 --> 01:47:27,020
I decided to wear this suit
instead of my tired old uniform.

1642
01:47:27,096 --> 01:47:29,690
- Oh, that's no problem.
- So, how much is it?

1643
01:47:29,765 --> 01:47:33,257
Okay, there's a blouse,

1644
01:47:33,335 --> 01:47:35,844
pants.

1645
01:47:35,904 --> 01:47:39,673
Comes to $267.

1646
01:47:39,742 --> 01:47:41,869
Okay.

1647
01:47:43,445 --> 01:47:46,642
- Wait! Your change.
- Oh.

1648
01:47:46,715 --> 01:47:51,152
Uh, by the way, someone left a bag of
beach towels in the last dressing room.

1649
01:49:22,910 --> 01:49:25,845
Ray, Ray, Ray, come out
wherever you are! Ray!

1650
01:49:25,884 --> 01:49:28,717
Ray, come out! Ray, Melanie,
she burst into the dressing room.

1651
01:49:28,751 --> 01:49:30,810
She took all the money
and ran out!

1652
01:49:37,499 --> 01:49:39,686
Aw, fuck.

1653
01:49:40,279 --> 01:49:42,526
Come on. Goddamn, we're late.
Come on.

1654
01:49:44,246 --> 01:49:45,992
- Come on.
- What the fuck?

1655
01:49:46,068 --> 01:49:49,196
We should've been there already, and we would've
if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around.

1656
01:49:49,271 --> 01:49:51,466
Jesus Christ, Louis, maintain.

1657
01:49:54,343 --> 01:49:56,607
- Jesus. Ow!
- Just... I'm telling you, cut the shit.

1658
01:49:56,678 --> 01:49:59,112
Ow.

1659
01:50:03,764 --> 01:50:05,517
Idiot.

1660
01:50:05,587 --> 01:50:07,521
- Just let go.
- Straighten up, bitch.

1661
01:50:07,589 --> 01:50:09,580
- You fuckin' mongoloid.
- Fuckin'...

1662
01:50:09,658 --> 01:50:13,041
Oh, now, look at this. This is nice...

1663
01:50:13,134 --> 01:50:16,254
I think I like it.
I'll take it. I'm in a hurry.

1664
01:50:16,294 --> 01:50:18,065
- Can you ring it up for me?
- Cash or charge?

1665
01:50:18,133 --> 01:50:20,067
Cash.

1666
01:50:26,374 --> 01:50:29,744
It's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go
over and look at this Michi Moon display.

1667
01:50:29,812 --> 01:50:33,407
You just stay right fuckin' here,
all right? Just stay right here.

1668
01:50:33,482 --> 01:50:36,042
Are you sweating?

1669
01:50:37,391 --> 01:50:39,985
Job a little too much for you?

1670
01:50:49,931 --> 01:50:51,225
I'm gonna be over there.

1671
01:50:51,300 --> 01:50:54,599
- You just stay right here.
- 'Cause you're a little bit too conspicuous.

1672
01:50:54,670 --> 01:50:59,073
I don't care how conspicuous,
you fuckin' stay here.

1673
01:50:59,141 --> 01:51:01,281
Hey, would you let go!

1674
01:51:07,833 --> 01:51:09,340
Designer Clothes.

1675
01:51:14,982 --> 01:51:16,556
Fuck it.

1676
01:51:45,698 --> 01:51:46,720
Look, where you goin'?

1677
01:51:46,788 --> 01:51:48,722
- Getting out of here. What do you think?
- Let me have the bag.

1678
01:51:48,790 --> 01:51:51,782
- Fuck you. I can carry it.
- Goddamn, give me the bag.

1679
01:51:51,860 --> 01:51:54,693
- Fuck you...
- What, you're gonna rip the fuckin' bag?

1680
01:51:54,763 --> 01:51:57,630
Give me that bag
before I knock you the fuck up.

1681
01:51:57,699 --> 01:52:00,502
- Take your fuckin' hands off.
- Okay, okay. Jesus, what's wrong with you?

1682
01:52:00,529 --> 01:52:03,289
- I'm carryin' the bag.
- All right, you got it. Take a chill pill, for chrissake.

1683
01:52:03,316 --> 01:52:05,633
Fuck you and your chill pill.

1684
01:52:05,707 --> 01:52:09,871
Remember where we came in?
No, that's towards Sears.

1685
01:52:09,945 --> 01:52:13,142
Where the f...
Which way? Which way?

1686
01:52:17,052 --> 01:52:20,510
Jesus, but if you two aren't
the biggest pair of fuck-ups...

1687
01:52:20,589 --> 01:52:23,080
I've ever met in my entire life.

1688
01:52:23,158 --> 01:52:25,991
How did you ever rob a bank?

1689
01:52:26,061 --> 01:52:29,553
Hey, when you robbed banks, did you
have to look for your car then too?

1690
01:52:30,666 --> 01:52:33,100
No wonder you went to jail.

1691
01:52:35,603 --> 01:52:37,270
Is it this aisle, Louis?

1692
01:52:38,106 --> 01:52:40,040
Is it?

1693
01:52:44,813 --> 01:52:46,246
Louis?

1694
01:52:47,950 --> 01:52:51,553
Lou-isss?

1695
01:52:53,922 --> 01:52:56,857
Is it this aisle,
or is it the next one over?

1696
01:52:58,793 --> 01:53:00,526
- It's this one.
- You sure?

1697
01:53:00,580 --> 01:53:03,295
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- You positive? You don't seem sure to me.

1698
01:53:03,338 --> 01:53:05,080
Hey, don't say...

1699
01:53:06,301 --> 01:53:09,107
Don't say anything else, okay?
Keep your mouth shut.

1700
01:53:09,471 --> 01:53:12,907
- Well...
- I mean it. Don't say one fuckin' word, okay?

1701
01:53:13,494 --> 01:53:14,788
Okay, Louis.

1702
01:53:24,353 --> 01:53:26,617
See, just where I said it was.

1703

1718
01:54:56,778 --> 01:54:59,747
- Straighten up, bitch.

1719
01:54:59,815 --> 01:55:03,751
- Now, look at this.
- I think I like it.

1720
01:55:03,819 --> 01:55:05,753
I'll take it. I'm in a hurry.
Can you ring it up for me?

1721
01:55:06,120 --> 01:55:08,334

1724

1726
01:56:13,942 --> 01:56:18,354
- Okay, blouse, pants.
- And away we go.

1727
01:56:18,427 --> 01:56:21,590
Comes to $267.

1728
01:56:21,663 --> 01:56:22,734

Excuse me.

1732
01:56:56,898 --> 01:57:00,732
My wife thinks she left a bag
of beach towels in the fitting room.

1733
01:57:00,802 --> 01:57:03,862
Yeah, I think they're there. Go get 'em.
There's nobody in there.

1734
01:57:04,199 --> 01:57:05,619
- Thanks.
- Last stall.

1735
01:58:19,481 --> 01:58:20,187

where all them car dealerships is.

1741
01:59:58,179 --> 02:00:00,192
We gonna leave this heap
in the parking lot and pick up

1742
02:00:00,265 --> 02:00:03,264
a car the cops don't know
nothin' about.

1743
02:00:04,204 --> 02:00:05,104
Where's Melanie?

1744
02:00:05,171 --> 02:00:07,984
Well, that's what I wanna tell you. You
see, she was buggin' me the whole time.

1745
02:00:08,056 --> 02:00:10,737
She got pissy with me 'cause
I wouldn't let her carry the bag.

1746
02:00:10,784 --> 02:00:13,559
And then she started runnin' her
fuckin' mouth about, you know, like...

1747
02:00:13,595 --> 02:00:16,257
'cause I couldn't remember where the car
was parked right away when we came out.

1748
02:00:16,331 --> 02:00:19,198
So then she got on me about that.
"Is it this aisle, Louis?

1749
02:00:19,267 --> 02:00:22,028
Is it that aisle, Louis?" It was
totally fuckin' with my nerves, man.

1750
02:00:22,037 --> 02:00:25,302
- So, what? You left her there?
- I-I shot her.

1751
02:00:29,436 --> 02:00:30,775
You shot Melanie?

1752
02:00:30,845 --> 02:00:33,814
- Twice. In the parking lot.
- You couldn't talk to her?

1753
02:00:33,882 --> 02:00:36,976
- Well, how can you talk to her? You know how she is.
- You couldn't just hit her?

1754
02:00:37,052 --> 02:00:40,215
Maybe, but at that time...
moment, I don't know, I...

1755
02:00:40,288 --> 02:00:42,586
You shot her? Twice?

1756
02:00:44,526 --> 02:00:48,719
- Is she dead?
- I-I... Pretty much.

1757
02:00:48,839 --> 02:00:50,831
What do you mean "pretty much", Louis?
That ain't no fuckin' answer.

1758
02:00:50,899 --> 02:00:52,924
- Yes or no. Is she dead?
- I-I think so.

1759
02:00:53,001 --> 02:00:55,601
- You think so? Tell me Louis. Is she...
- She's dead. She's dead.

1760
02:00:55,603 --> 02:00:58,367
- Well, where'd you shoot her?
- In the chest and the stomach.

1761
02:01:00,327 --> 02:01:03,199
If you had to do it,
then you had to do it, brother.

1762
02:01:03,794 --> 02:01:06,042
What we don't want
is that bitch survivin' on us.

1763
02:01:06,067 --> 02:01:08,048
You know? Anybody but that woman.

1764
02:01:21,822 --> 02:01:23,262
Louis?

1765
02:01:23,296 --> 02:01:25,309
What?

1766
02:01:25,362 --> 02:01:27,134
Where's the rest of it?

1767
02:01:27,202 --> 02:01:31,536
- How much is there?
- I don't know. Maybe 40. Shit, maybe less.

1768
02:01:31,974 --> 02:01:34,166
Well, you... you said 550.

1769
02:01:34,242 --> 02:01:37,734
Yeah, so you light, ain't you?
You light about half a million, ten.

1770
02:01:37,812 --> 02:01:40,110
Look, look, man.
That's the bag she came out with.

1771
02:01:40,181 --> 02:01:42,777
- She never put her hand in it. Neither did I.
- Came out of where?

1772
02:01:42,823 --> 02:01:45,645
Out of the fitting room. It went down
exactly the way it was supposed to.

1773
02:01:45,720 --> 02:01:49,053
- How long was she in there?
- A minute. Not even a minute. She came right out.

1774
02:01:49,124 --> 02:01:51,854
- Louis, you tellin' me the truth?
- Listen, I swear to fuckin' God, man.

1775
02:01:51,926 --> 02:01:55,589
I swear on my life. She came out with
that fuckin' bag, and I took it from her.

1776
02:01:55,663 --> 02:01:57,654
- And then what?
- And that was it. We went to the parking lot.

1777
02:01:57,732 --> 02:02:01,259
- Where you shot her?
- That's right.

1778
02:02:01,269 --> 02:02:03,822
Louis, you sure Melanie ain't in a room
somewhere with a half million dollars...

1779
02:02:03,869 --> 02:02:05,716
I worked my ass off to get
waitin' for you?

1780
02:02:05,782 --> 02:02:09,476
- Oh, fuck you for asking me that.
- Hey, I know the bitch tried to set me up.

1781
02:02:09,516 --> 02:02:12,623
- Fuck you, brother. How could you fuckin' ask me that?
- She didn't ask you?

1782
02:02:15,456 --> 02:02:17,063
Shit!

1783
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:21,612
Pull the car over a minute.

1784
02:02:23,691 --> 02:02:25,625
Why'd you ask me that?

1785
02:02:34,847 --> 02:02:36,369
All right, so where's
the gun you shot her with?

1786
02:02:36,437 --> 02:02:38,371
It's in there.

1787
02:02:41,161 --> 02:02:44,174
Now, what the fuck's that gonna tell ya?
I could've taken two out already.

1788
02:03:10,324 --> 02:03:12,131
It's Jackie Brown.

1789
02:03:14,708 --> 02:03:16,922
Well, you know, if she got to it,
why didn't she take it al?

1790
02:03:16,962 --> 02:03:19,882
Oh, I'll be sure and ask that bitch
before I blow her brains out.

1791
02:03:20,515 --> 02:03:21,774
Well, maybe the Feds got it.

1792
02:03:21,850 --> 02:03:24,890
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. See, if there wasn't
nothin' in that bag but them towels,

1793
02:03:24,919 --> 02:03:27,149
then maybe she didn't get
a chance to take the money...

1794
02:03:27,222 --> 02:03:29,156
out of her suitcase
and the A.T.F. got it.

1795
02:03:29,224 --> 02:03:31,215
But she put them books
in there to trick our ass.

1796
02:03:31,292 --> 02:03:33,283
Well, that's why I didn't check it.
Because the bag felt right.

1797
02:03:33,361 --> 02:03:37,229
That's right. And then she puts 40 grand or
so in there to rub that shit in my face.

1798
02:03:37,298 --> 02:03:40,597
You know what I'm sayin'?
She wants me to know she ripped me off.

1799
02:03:40,668 --> 02:03:45,071
Ah. I don... I don... You know,
I don't know. I don't know.

1800
02:03:45,139 --> 02:03:48,438
Unless, you know, either she's
got it or the Feds got it.

1801
02:03:48,509 --> 02:03:51,706
Or... Or... Now, check this out.

1802
02:03:52,235 --> 02:03:54,714
What if she gave the money
to somebody else first...

1803
02:03:54,782 --> 02:03:57,751
before Melanie even went
in the dressing room.

1804
02:03:57,819 --> 02:03:59,753
Uh-huh.

1805
02:04:01,869 --> 02:04:04,009
- Oh, man. You know what?
- What?

1806
02:04:04,049 --> 02:04:07,761
- Do you know who I saw in the dress department?
- No, tell me.

1807
02:04:07,829 --> 02:04:11,094
I didn't think anything of it. I... No, no,
I did wonder what he was doin' there.

1808
02:04:11,165 --> 02:04:13,998
I wondered what he was doin' there,
but I thought it had nothin' to do with us.

1809
02:04:14,068 --> 02:04:16,497
Like, maybe he was with his wife
or his girlfriend. It's a big place...

1810
02:04:16,537 --> 02:04:19,568
Louis, Louis, Louis!
You gonna tell me who you saw?

1811
02:04:19,641 --> 02:04:22,303
- Yeah, Max Cherry.
- Max Che...

1812
02:04:26,814 --> 02:04:29,794
You seen Max Cherry
in the dress department where we...

1813
02:04:29,827 --> 02:04:32,534
Man, look at me
when I'm talkin' to you!

1814
02:04:32,567 --> 02:04:35,860
You see that motherfucker in the dress department
when we about to get a half million dollars.

1815
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:38,073
- And you don't think nothin' about him bein' there?
- No. Do they know each other?

1816
02:04:38,087 --> 02:04:40,513
Hell, yeah, they know each other.
He bonded her ass out of County.

1817
02:04:40,539 --> 02:04:43,579
- Well, how am I supposed to know that?
- You know your bail bondsmen, don't you?

1818
02:04:43,666 --> 02:04:46,399
You know all them motherfuckers is crooked
as a barrel of snakes, don't you?

1819
02:04:46,433 --> 02:04:48,279
Why should I think something's weird if I don't
know nothin' about them knowin' each other?

1820
02:04:48,346 --> 02:04:51,553
- I don't wanna hear no fuckin' excuses, Louis.
- I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, man.

1821
02:04:51,606 --> 02:04:54,302
But I'm tellin' you... I don't fuckin'...
I'm givin' you fuckin' reasons.

1822
02:04:54,375 --> 02:04:56,536
Oh, you gonna tell me
the reason...

1823
02:04:56,611 --> 02:04:58,931
you lost every goddamned cent
I got in the world?

1824
02:04:58,977 --> 02:05:01,976
- Hey... Hey, man.
- You gonna tell me reasons?

1825
02:05:02,050 --> 02:05:04,370
- You better...
- Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker.

1826
02:05:04,385 --> 02:05:07,377
The reason is your ass
ain't worth a shit no more.

1827
02:05:07,455 --> 02:05:09,855
You better fuckin' back off, man.

1828
02:05:16,497 --> 02:05:20,263
What the fuck happened to you, man?

1829
02:05:20,335 --> 02:05:22,841
Her ass used to be beautiful.

1830
02:06:07,355 --> 02:06:09,481
You didn't tell me
you were goin' shoppin'.

1831
02:06:10,184 --> 02:06:12,812
- I thought I did.
- Yeah, well, you didn't.

1832
02:06:20,828 --> 02:06:23,456
You know, if it's me...

1833
02:06:23,531 --> 02:06:26,796
and I got all that shit hangin' over
my head like you got hangin' over yours,

1834
02:06:26,868 --> 02:06:29,098
I don't know,
I'd go shoppin' later.

1835
02:06:29,170 --> 02:06:32,196
Well, I got there early.
You see, I've had my eye on this suit...

1836
02:06:32,273 --> 02:06:33,865
that I've wanted, and, well,
I'm just gonna go try it on...

1837
02:06:33,941 --> 02:06:35,875
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Wait, wait, wait. Just wait a minute.

1838
02:06:35,943 --> 02:06:40,209
Just wait a fuckin' second, all right?
Let me finish.

1839
02:06:40,874 --> 02:06:44,877
I got there early. The idea was to
try on the suit, see if I liked it.

1840
02:06:44,952 --> 02:06:47,713
If I did, they would wrap it up,
and I would put back on my uniform...

1841
02:06:47,755 --> 02:06:50,485
'cause Sheronda
is expecting me to wear it.

1842
02:06:50,558 --> 02:06:54,426
Meet Sheronda, give her the shopping bag
with the $50,000 and go home.

1843
02:06:55,501 --> 02:06:57,215
Yeah, but you didn't do that.

1844
02:06:57,235 --> 02:06:59,235
Because I couldn't.
Ray, I swear.

1845
02:06:59,267 --> 02:07:01,997
Melanie burst in.
She grabbed the bag.

1846
02:07:02,070 --> 02:07:04,538
And then somebody
fuckin' killed her for it.

1847
02:07:12,192 --> 02:07:13,405
What happened
to the bag she gave you?

1848
02:07:13,418 --> 02:07:18,308
She didn't give me a bag.
Melanie was not a part of the plan.

1849
02:07:19,118 --> 02:07:20,411
Ordell probably told her
to do it.

1850
02:07:20,458 --> 02:07:22,751
That's why she came into the dressing
room, grabbed the bag, took off.

1851
02:07:22,784 --> 02:07:25,625
But I couldn't go after her,
because I was in my fucking underwear.

1852
02:07:25,693 --> 02:07:28,218
And I had to put on this suit because I
could put it on faster than my uniform...

1853
02:07:28,296 --> 02:07:31,163
- You had time to pay the sales chick.
- I had to. Ray, I was frantic.

1854
02:07:31,232 --> 02:07:33,928
What was I supposed to do?

1855
02:07:40,446 --> 02:07:42,633
All right,
what you do after that?

1856
02:07:42,720 --> 02:07:45,341
I went lookin' for you. And I went
back to the place in the mall...

1857
02:07:45,413 --> 02:07:47,506
where you were before,
but you weren't there.

1858
02:07:47,568 --> 02:07:51,619
What was I supposed to do if something happens?
You didn't tell me how to do that, did you?

1859
02:07:52,266 --> 02:07:54,052
There was a guy with Melanie?

1860
02:07:54,091 --> 02:07:56,095
There was nobody
in the fitting room.

1861
02:08:00,967 --> 02:08:01,885
Okay.

1862
02:08:10,456 --> 02:08:12,495
You've no idea what happened
to the $50,000.

1863
02:08:12,573 --> 02:08:15,273
You're clueless about the money, right?
You've no idea where the 50 grand is?

1864
02:08:15,275 --> 02:08:16,010
I have no idea.

1865
02:08:16,077 --> 02:08:19,003
None. You have no idea... It could've
gone here, could've gone there?

1866
02:08:19,050 --> 02:08:22,907
I know nothin'. Not a clue. I don't have
an idea where the motherfuckin' money is.

1867
02:08:22,984 --> 02:08:25,350
- Not even a little idea. A maybe.
- Not a little tiny motherfuckin' idea.

1868
02:08:25,419 --> 02:08:29,076
- You'd take a polygraph?
- Yeah, if it'd motherfuckin' make you happy!

1869
02:08:29,129 --> 02:08:31,883
Yeah, put it right there.
I'll do it.

1870
02:08:32,552 --> 02:08:33,893
Man.

1871
02:08:42,656 --> 02:08:45,750
I sure hope you didn't do
anything stupid, Jackie.

1872
02:08:50,737 --> 02:08:52,838
Can I talk to you for a second?

1873
02:09:08,775 --> 02:09:09,662
Fuck.

1874
02:09:25,673 --> 02:09:30,600
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him
shot in the car on Ninth.

1875
02:09:30,633 --> 02:09:32,899
And we lost Ordell.

1876
02:09:32,959 --> 02:09:35,723
I thought you were
fuckin' watchin' him.

1877
02:09:36,253 --> 02:09:38,252
We were, and we lost him.

1878
02:09:38,326 --> 02:09:42,194
He walked into a strip bar sometime
around 3:30 and never came out.

1879
02:09:42,596 --> 02:09:47,049
The bar was on Ninth, what, less than a mile
and a half from where they found Louis dead.

1880
02:09:47,103 --> 02:09:49,523
It looks like Louis' buddy
shot him twice, point-blank range.

1881
02:09:49,544 --> 02:09:53,071
- So what's gonna happen now?
- We pick up Ordell.

1882
02:09:53,470 --> 02:09:56,200
We got three murders we can link him to,
and we got you.

1883
02:09:57,970 --> 02:10:00,130
- What about me?
- What about you?

1884
02:10:02,362 --> 02:10:04,536
You think I took
some of that money?

1885
02:10:04,551 --> 02:10:07,042
Hey, I have no evidence
of you doin' anything.

1886
02:10:08,823 --> 02:10:11,603
You didn't pay for that snazzy new suit
with marked bills.

1887
02:10:11,659 --> 02:10:13,750
I'm glad to see that.

1888
02:10:14,111 --> 02:10:17,592
You've been helpin' us out. You
gave us Melanie. You gave us Louis.

1889
02:10:18,078 --> 02:10:23,399
Melanie was found with a packet
of marked bills stuffed in her shorts.

1890
02:10:23,471 --> 02:10:26,372
That goes a long way
in backing up your story.

1891
02:10:28,776 --> 02:10:31,711
I'll settle for Ordell
with marked bills.

1892
02:10:34,715 --> 02:10:37,047
But if there's anything else...

1893
02:10:37,118 --> 02:10:42,112
you haven't told me about, you know
what, that's between you and Ordell.

1894
02:10:42,189 --> 02:10:45,317
I just got one thing to say.

1895
02:10:45,393 --> 02:10:48,385
You better hope we find him
before he finds you.

1896
02:10:48,509 --> 02:10:52,190
No, no, man, I done told you,
I can't leave here tomorrow, Mr. Walker.

1897
02:10:52,266 --> 02:10:57,294
I ain't goin' no goddamn way anyway
till I get my motherfuckin' money.

1898
02:10:57,371 --> 02:11:01,398
Come on, man, if it wasn't for me, you
wouldn't have that motherfuckin' boat.

1899
02:11:01,475 --> 02:11:05,912
Oh, yeah, yeah, right. I'm seein' who
my friends are, motherfucker, right...

1900
02:11:05,980 --> 02:11:09,575
Hello? Hello?

1901
02:11:10,089 --> 02:11:13,586
Motherfucker hung up on me.
You believe that shit?

1902
02:11:13,654 --> 02:11:17,920
Ingrate nigger.
See, you bring a motherfucker up,

1903
02:11:17,992 --> 02:11:21,359
next thing you know they breaking
you off some goddamned disrespect.

1904
02:11:21,429 --> 02:11:24,830
Motherfuck! Shit!

1905
02:11:25,879 --> 02:11:29,232
Goddamn, girl.
How you live like this?

1906
02:11:29,303 --> 02:11:31,828
- Like what?
- Like this.

1907
02:11:31,906 --> 02:11:34,397
This some repugnant shit.

1908
02:11:37,101 --> 02:11:38,148
Bail bonds.

1909
02:11:38,195 --> 02:11:40,446
- Yeah, Max there?
- He ain't here right now, man.

1910
02:11:40,514 --> 02:11:43,449
- Well, where he at? Out of town?
- He's around, man.

1911
02:11:43,517 --> 02:11:45,849
- Well, give me his home number.
<i>- No, I'll give you his beeper number!</i>

1912
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:48,115
All right.
Break out the beeper number, nigger.

1913
02:11:56,697 --> 02:12:00,155
- Yeah.
- I've been looking for you.

1914
02:12:00,754 --> 02:12:05,365
- Do you know who this is?
- This is Mr. Robbie, isn't it?

1915
02:12:05,607 --> 02:12:08,431
<i>I have your 10,000.
That's why you called.</i>

1916
02:12:10,277 --> 02:12:14,270
The bond collateral that you put down
on Beaumont Livingston...

1917
02:12:14,348 --> 02:12:16,839
and moved over
to Miss Brown, remember?

1918
02:12:17,952 --> 02:12:20,045
Oh, she got off, did she?

1919
02:12:20,712 --> 02:12:23,318
They decided to no-file
this morning.

1920
02:12:23,391 --> 02:12:25,689
Tell me where you are.
I'll come give you your money.

1921
02:12:31,029 --> 02:12:32,037
You still there?

1922
02:12:34,101 --> 02:12:37,434
Look here, man.
I know you helped her.

1923
02:12:37,505 --> 02:12:39,653
And I know you know what I want.

1924
02:12:40,119 --> 02:12:43,102
<i>And Jackie can tell me any story
comes into her pretty little head,</i>

1925
02:12:43,177 --> 02:12:48,171
as long as at the end of that story
she hands me my motherfuckin' money.

1926
02:12:48,249 --> 02:12:52,083
Now, she wanna be my friend,
she do that.

1927
02:12:52,153 --> 02:12:54,815
She don't want to be
my friend no more,

1928
02:12:54,889 --> 02:12:58,256
well, you just tell her
to think about old Beaumont.

1929
02:12:58,325 --> 02:13:00,418
And if she go to the police,

1930
02:13:00,494 --> 02:13:04,157
you tell her I will name her ass
as my accessory.

1931
02:13:04,231 --> 02:13:08,735
And we'll go upstate,
hand in handcuffed motherfuckin' hand.

1932
02:13:08,769 --> 02:13:11,966
And that's a promise.
Do you understand what I'm sayin'?

1933
02:13:12,475 --> 02:13:15,531
You tell her that,
and I'll call you back.

1934
02:13:18,712 --> 02:13:22,375
You're right. It was Ordell.

1935
02:13:22,863 --> 02:13:27,463
If you have time, do you think you could
find out where he's stayin' for me?

1936
02:13:28,196 --> 02:13:30,190
Cops can't locate him, huh?

1937
02:13:30,243 --> 02:13:33,621
They don't have
your winning personality.

1938
02:13:33,694 --> 02:13:37,755
Sure thing. I don't have to know what
I'm doing, just as long as you know.

1939
02:13:38,772 --> 02:13:41,324
I think I do. Good enough?

1940
02:13:41,402 --> 02:13:43,336
You bet.

1941
02:13:58,452 --> 02:14:00,943
Fuck's wrong with you, knockin' on
the door like the goddamned police?

1942
02:14:01,021 --> 02:14:03,546
- You lookin' to get shot?
- I thought you might be asleep.

1943
02:14:03,624 --> 02:14:06,991
You keep fuckin' with me,
you the one gonna be asleep... forever.

1944
02:14:08,380 --> 02:14:09,689
I'm alone.

1945
02:14:09,763 --> 02:14:12,698
Get your ass in the house.

1946
02:14:18,339 --> 02:14:20,330
No, freeze, motherfucker.
What you doin'?

1947
02:14:20,407 --> 02:14:24,343
Got your money...
your bond refund?

1948
02:14:25,377 --> 02:14:26,675
This all?

1949
02:14:26,747 --> 02:14:28,806
- I have a receipt for you to sign.
- No, no, no, motherfucker.

1950
02:14:28,883 --> 02:14:31,852
You know what I mean.
You talked to her?

1951
02:14:31,919 --> 02:14:34,353
She wants to give you
your money.

1952
02:14:34,421 --> 02:14:38,016
If she didn't, there'd be cops
batter-ramming your door down right now.

1953
02:14:38,092 --> 02:14:40,322
- How'd you find me, anyway?
- Winston found you.

1954
02:14:40,394 --> 02:14:42,385
- How'd he find me?
- That's what he does.

1955
02:14:42,463 --> 02:14:44,397
He finds people
that don't wanna be found.

1956
02:14:44,465 --> 02:14:47,025
Oh, well, bully for that nigger.

1957
02:14:47,101 --> 02:14:49,262
So, she wanna give me
my money, huh?

1958
02:14:49,336 --> 02:14:54,740
Yeah. She wants to give it to you herself,
and she wants to collect her ten percent.

1959
02:14:54,808 --> 02:14:58,039
She also wants to explain
why she had to hang on to it.

1960
02:14:58,112 --> 02:15:00,876
Oh, and I wanna hear
that shit too.

1961
02:15:00,948 --> 02:15:03,883
Turn around.
Put your hands on your head.

1962
02:15:10,658 --> 02:15:13,456
Why don't you tell me why?

1963
02:15:13,527 --> 02:15:16,963
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already
tried to get Jackie to go in with her,

1964
02:15:17,031 --> 02:15:20,194
split the half million
amongst themselves.

1965
02:15:20,267 --> 02:15:23,896
What she did was take quite a risk
to make sure you got your money.

1966
02:15:25,333 --> 02:15:27,065
And you helped her, didn't you?

1967
02:15:27,141 --> 02:15:29,200
All I did was walk out with it.

1968
02:15:29,843 --> 02:15:33,056
Y'all went to all that trouble
just to protect my interest?

1969
02:15:33,981 --> 02:15:36,347
In a way, yes.

1970
02:15:38,852 --> 02:15:43,653
My ass may be dumb,
but I ain't no dumb ass.

1971
02:15:44,264 --> 02:15:46,357
Go over there and sit
on that couch.

1972
02:15:47,595 --> 02:15:50,325
Don't worry about her.
She don't even know you're here.

1973
02:15:50,397 --> 02:15:52,831
Sit down.

1974
02:15:53,606 --> 02:15:54,891
Place stinks.

1975
02:15:54,969 --> 02:15:57,096
You get used to it.

1976
02:15:58,372 --> 02:16:01,136
- Where my money at?
- My office.

1977
02:16:01,208 --> 02:16:04,194
- Where Jackie at?
- She's been there since Thursday night.

1978
02:16:04,248 --> 02:16:06,420
If she want to talk to me,
how come she wasn't home?

1979
02:16:06,480 --> 02:16:09,736
- She's afraid.
- Oh, right. That I gotta see.

1980
02:16:09,790 --> 02:16:13,437
She still is. She doesn't wanna get shot
before she can tell you what happened.

1981
02:16:13,500 --> 02:16:16,765
- Tell her to bring the money over here.
- It's in the safe:, she can't.

1982
02:16:16,851 --> 02:16:18,686
Call her and give her
the combination.

1983
02:16:18,726 --> 02:16:21,359
Look, I'm tellin' you,
you got her spooked.

1984
02:16:21,428 --> 02:16:24,679
She won't leave there till you
get your money and you're gone.

1985
02:16:24,739 --> 02:16:26,730
Oh, you expect me
to just go walkin' in there?

1986
02:16:26,787 --> 02:16:29,572
If she wanted to set you up,
you'd be in custody by now.

1987
02:16:29,625 --> 02:16:33,796
When you told her that you'd name her as an
accessory, that scared her more than anything.

1988
02:16:33,874 --> 02:16:37,587
- She believed you.
- Mmm.

1989
02:16:37,620 --> 02:16:40,441
Then that's why she wanted
to give me my money, ain't it?

1990
02:16:40,514 --> 02:16:44,211
It ain't got nothin' to do
with that bullshit about Melanie, huh?

1991
02:16:44,650 --> 02:16:47,879
See, I ain't trust Melanie,
either, but I could handle her.

1992
02:16:47,955 --> 02:16:50,719
That was my little
blonde-haired surfer girl.

1993
02:16:52,559 --> 02:16:55,558
And I told that fuckin' Louis all he
had to do was hit her in the mouth.

1994
02:16:55,599 --> 02:16:59,028
But no, he had to shoot her.

1995
02:17:02,916 --> 02:17:05,467
- Jackie's at your office, huh?
- Uh-huh.

1996
02:17:05,539 --> 02:17:08,570
She by herself? That big-ass nigger
Winston ain't there, is he?

1997
02:17:08,596 --> 02:17:10,216
She's all alone.

1998
02:17:11,971 --> 02:17:13,378
All right.

1999
02:17:14,014 --> 02:17:17,725
I call over there,
she better answer the phone.

2000
02:17:17,778 --> 02:17:19,712
She will.

2001
02:17:28,615 --> 02:17:33,192
I'll be here. See you in a bit.

2002
02:18:10,284 --> 02:18:13,836
Goddamn. In all the time I've known her,

2003
02:18:13,907 --> 02:18:16,603
I ain't never heard her
scared like that.

2004
02:18:16,677 --> 02:18:19,271
Usually, she too cool
for school.

2005
02:18:19,585 --> 02:18:23,646
Hold up, home.
Give me the keys. I'll drive.

2006
02:19:11,398 --> 02:19:13,992
I didn't know
you liked the Delfonics.

2007
02:19:16,749 --> 02:19:18,740
They're pretty good.

that office, right?

2018
02:20:59,839 --> 02:21:02,308
If she start giving me some
bullshit about it ain't there...

2019
02:21:02,376 --> 02:21:05,277
and we gotta go
someplace else and get it,

2020
02:21:05,324 --> 02:21:08,909
I'm gonna shoot you in the head
right then and there.

2021
02:21:10,104 --> 02:21:14,443
Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the
kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is.

2022
02:21:14,980 --> 02:21:16,981
She gonna tell I me too.

2023
02:21:18,341 --> 02:21:21,226
Hey, look at me when I'm
talkin' to you, motherfucker.

2024
02:21:24,938 --> 02:21:26,585
Listen.

2025
02:21:27,011 --> 02:21:31,463
I go walkin' in there and that nigger
Winston or anybody else is in there,

2026
02:21:31,538 --> 02:21:34,632
you the first motherfucker gets shot,
you understand me?

2027
02:21:35,894 --> 02:21:36,938
Yeah.

2028
02:21:39,313 --> 02:21:43,147
There ain't nothin' you wanna tell me
before we get out of this car, is there?

2029
02:21:43,622 --> 02:21:48,279
- No.
- Last chance, motherfucker. You sure?

2030
02:21:54,161 --> 02:21:56,595
You better be, motherfucker.

2031
02:21:59,085 --> 02:22:00,300
All right.

2032
02:22:01,213 --> 02:22:02,432
Let's roll.

2033
02:22:15,781 --> 02:22:17,239
You got the key, right?

2034
02:22:20,053 --> 02:22:24,353
All right, now, when we get up in here,
you go up in here slow, all right?

2035
02:22:24,424 --> 02:22:26,585
I want you to keep your ass
in front of me.

2036
02:22:26,660 --> 02:22:29,720
Don't be fuckin' around
herky-jerky or nothin'.

2037
02:22:35,736 --> 02:22:38,671
Why it so dark in here?

2038
02:22:44,244 --> 02:22:48,271
Say, Jackie. That you?

2039
02:22:48,348 --> 02:22:50,282
Yeah.

2040
02:22:56,061 --> 02:22:57,841
Goddamn, girl.

2041
02:22:57,881 --> 02:22:59,961
What you doin' sittin' off
in here in the dark?

2042
02:23:02,854 --> 02:23:04,158
Ray, he's got a gun!

2043
02:23:24,230 --> 02:23:25,775
He dead?

2044
02:23:25,852 --> 02:23:27,310
Yeah, he's dead.

2045
02:23:29,510 --> 02:23:31,704
Does he have the marked bills on him?

2046
02:23:31,764 --> 02:23:34,991
He oughta have 40,000
in his pocket there...

2047
02:23:35,062 --> 02:23:38,190
and maybe another 10,000
I gave him.

2048
02:23:38,265 --> 02:23:40,893
Why'd you give him $10,000?

2049
02:23:40,967 --> 02:23:42,887
Returned a bond collateral. I

2050
02:23:42,923 --> 02:23:46,120
brought it to him so he
wouldn't have to come here.

2051
02:23:47,274 --> 02:23:49,299
Well, how'd you know
where he was?

2052
02:23:49,376 --> 02:23:51,469
I found him.

2053
02:23:51,545 --> 02:23:54,537
- What do you mean you found him?
- That's my job.

2054
02:23:54,614 --> 02:23:58,914
- You guys didn't tell the police?
- I told Jackie.

2055
02:23:58,985 --> 02:24:01,715
She said you wanted him.

2056
02:24:02,301 --> 02:24:03,934
Ray?

2057
02:24:05,621 --> 02:24:09,024
Remember when you said you hoped
you'd get him before he gets me?

2058
02:24:09,096 --> 02:24:11,462
Mm-hmm.

2059
02:24:11,531 --> 02:24:16,230
Well, you did. Thanks.

2060
02:24:38,351 --> 02:24:39,478
Knock, knock.

2061
02:24:40,557 --> 02:24:41,444
Hey.

2062
02:24:43,596 --> 02:24:45,383
Hey, you.

2063
02:24:45,416 --> 02:24:47,643
I got your package.

2064
02:24:47,676 --> 02:24:50,436
It was fun gettin'
a half million dollars in the mail.

2065
02:24:50,504 --> 02:24:53,871
- Less ten percent.
- Why'd you take so little?

2066
02:24:53,940 --> 02:24:57,637
- That's my fee.
- This isn't a bail bond, Max.

2067
02:24:57,711 --> 02:25:01,340
- I-I hesitated takin' that much.
- Well, you earned it.

2068
02:25:03,750 --> 02:25:05,980
Well, I'm leavin' now, and, you know,
I'm all packed up, ready to go...

2069
02:25:06,012 --> 02:25:10,250
- That's Ordell's.
- They confiscated everything else.

2070
02:25:10,757 --> 02:25:12,759
Registration was
in the glove box.

2071
02:25:12,792 --> 02:25:15,861
Keys were underneath the seat.
Hey.

2072
02:25:16,739 --> 02:25:19,865
What's the matter? Haven't you
ever borrowed somebody's car before?

2073
02:25:20,479 --> 02:25:22,197
Not after they're dead.

2074
02:25:26,098 --> 02:25:28,328
I didn't use you, Max.

2075
02:25:29,109 --> 02:25:31,695
I didn't say you did.

2076
02:25:32,379 --> 02:25:34,540
And I never lied to you.

2077
02:25:35,255 --> 02:25:38,345
- I know that.
- We're partners.

2078
02:25:38,491 --> 02:25:43,428
I'm 56 years old. I can't blame
anybody for anything I do.

2079
02:25:46,538 --> 02:25:48,551
Do you blame yourself
for helpin' me?

2080
02:25:48,628 --> 02:25:50,385
No.

2081
02:25:50,432 --> 02:25:53,545
Look, I'd really feel a whole lot better
if you took some more money.

2082
02:25:53,580 --> 02:25:57,424
You'll get over that.
Where you goin'?

2083
02:25:57,404 --> 02:26:00,237
- Spain.
- Madrid or Barcelona?

2084
02:26:00,307 --> 02:26:03,276
Mmm, Madrid first.
Have you been there?

2085
02:26:03,343 --> 02:26:07,404
- I hear they don't eat dinner until midnight.
- You wanna go?

2086
02:26:07,753 --> 02:26:10,553
Thanks, but, uh,
you have a good time.

2087
02:26:10,603 --> 02:26:13,401
You sure I can't twist your arm?

2088
02:26:13,687 --> 02:26:16,753
Thanks for sayin' that, but no.

2089
02:26:16,769 --> 02:26:18,313
Are you scared of me?

2090
02:26:21,561 --> 02:26:23,495
A little bit.

2091
02:27:01,968 --> 02:27:03,848
I'll send you a postcard.

2092
02:27:05,214 --> 02:27:06,731
Will you?

2093
02:27:06,759 --> 02:27:08,681
I sure will, partner.

2094
02:27:27,961 --> 02:27:31,727
You're running a business, Max.

2095
02:27:31,798 --> 02:27:34,164
Cherry Bail Bond.

2096
02:27:36,269 --> 02:27:39,204
Uh, what is it
your son's charged with?

2097
02:27:51,051 --> 02:27:54,487
Yes, that's
a very serious offence.

2098
02:27:55,934 --> 02:27:58,960
Is your son still in school?

2099
02:28:00,124 --> 02:28:03,125
Does his father still live
in the house?

2100
02:28:06,237 --> 02:28:09,964
Could I excuse myself? Would you
call me back in about half an hour?

2101
02:28:15,041 --> 02:28:16,667
Yes, thank you.
